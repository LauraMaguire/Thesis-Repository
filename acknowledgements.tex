\small{First, deep thanks to my advisor Loren Hough, who demonstrates that it's possible to combine thorough knowledge of physics, biology, theory, and experiment with truly supportive mentorship.  Loren's guidance and enthusiasm kept this project going, and I have gained immensely in both knowledge and skills along the way.  Meredith Betterton often acted as an unofficial advisor, and I greatly appreciate her talent for getting me un-stuck and moving forward.  Valuable ideas and advice also came from the rest of my committee: Matt Glaser, Noel Clark, and Franck Vernerey.

Many people made significant contributions to this project before and during my time on it.  My thanks go to Eric Verbeke, undergraduate extraordinaire, for his insights, dedication, and cloning skills.  Nate Crossette and Katie Rainey contributed much time and thought to the hydrogel designs.  Andrea Egan and Nick Bax laid the groundwork for this project.  I had the pleasure of mentoring Sophie Reskin and Elena Arroyo while they did excellent work on FG Nup aggregation.  Help also came from Scott Tilden, Taylor Moon, Lucrezia Cester, Paul Marchando, and Christopher Lawton.

Years of advice and assistance came from current and former labmates Allison Holt, Jeffre Allen, Nabanita Das, and Amanda Hollar.  Thanks go to close collaborator Mike Stefferson for his much-needed crash course in computational physics.  Special gratitude goes to Kathryn Wall, without whose knowledge, patience, and wisdom I would never have lasted as a physicist learning biochemistry.  

I owe a great deal to the CU/NIH Biophysics Training Program and its director Joe Falke, which jumpstarted me into biophysics.  Generous hydrogel help came from Sadhana Sharma, Stephanie Bryant, Ben Fairbanks, Danielle Konetski, and Christopher Bowman.   Many thanks to Annette Erbse of the Biochemistry Shared Instruments Pool and Joe Dragavon of the BioFrontiers Advanced Light Microscopy Core.  Thanks also to Jeeseong Hwang and Kim Briggman of NIST.  Last but not least, I am grateful to my family and friends who have supported me unwaveringly throughout this endeavor.}}

%First, deep thanks to Loren Hough, my advisor, who can pretty much do everything: physics, biology, theory, experiment, plus talking to people.  Also he has more ideas than anyone else I've ever met.  Beyond science stuff, Loren has been an extremely supportive advisor and stood up for me when I needed it.  He cares about inclusion and justice and that's pretty cool.

%Meredith Betterton often acted as an unofficial advisor and got me and Loren unstuck lots of times.  She's really good at seeing a way forward when things are confusing.  Thanks also go to the remaining members of my committee, Matt Glaser, Noel Clark, and Franck Vernery, for useful discussion (even though Franck got roped in at the last minute).

%Many people made significant contributions to this project before and during my time working on it.  I worked closely with Eric Verbeke, who really raised the bar for what I expected of undergrads.  He also clones way better than I do.  Nate Crossette and Katie Rainey contributed much time and thought to the hydrogel designs.  While they left soon after I started work, Andrea Egan and Nick Bax laid much of the groundwork for this project.  Andrea in particular gave me my very first crash course on experimental molecular biophysics.  I had the pleasure of mentoring Sophie Reskin and Elena Arroyo, both of whom did excellent work on the FG124 aggregation project.  Sophie in particular reworked the timecourse protocol significantly and got the only usable data out of it.  Scott Tilden did a lot of fiddly cloning for me and I deeply appreciate it.  Help also came from Taylor Moon, Lucrezia Cester, Paul Marchando, and Christopher Lawton.

%Thanks to my labmates Allison Holt, Jeffre Allen, and Nabanita Das for help and an overall supportive lab culture.
%
%Special gratitude goes to Kathryn Wall, without whose patience and insight I would never have made it as a physicist doing biochemistry.  I owe you for my endless beginner-level questions and for convincing me to hang in there during the rough parts.
%
%Besides working with Loren and Meredith on the theory stuff, I worked closely with Michael Stefferson, who contributed a lot and hung in there really well when things got frustrating.
%
%I wouldn't have been able to take much data at all without the assistance and advice of Annette Erbse and Joe Dragavon.
%
%Since I didn't know anything about hydrogels when I started working with them, I needed a lot of help.  Many thanks go to Sadhana Sharma and Stephanie Bryant, who taught me to make the gels in the first place and did a lot of troubleshooting on my behalf.  More troubleshooting generously came from Ben Fairbanks, Danielle Konetski, and Christopher Bowman.
%
%Thanks to Jeesong Hwang and Kim Briggman for trying really hard to get the FCS thing which I am not in fact going to mention anywhere else in this document to work.  Also to Steve Whitten for doing those viscosity measurements.  Probably I should thank Joe Falke for letting me be a biophysics trainee.

%Last but not least, thanks to my family and friends who supported me unwaveringly.
