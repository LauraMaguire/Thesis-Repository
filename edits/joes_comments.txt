“Brownian motion was first reported by Robert Brown in 1927” – or 1827?

“Inhomogeneous scattering of obstacles” – “by obstacles”?
Done

“such a giant number fluctuations” – “such as”

2): 
ch02 P 11 “fast intra-particle diffusion times,”  - what are the “particles” referred to here?
In this case, some protein-rich P granules. But intra-particle here just means within a cell. Not changed.
Done

ch02 p. 12 “We use lattice Monte Carlo methods to explore a range binding energy and
obstacle filling fraction.” – grammar problem here
Done

ch02 p.12 “the step rate occurs at at fixed interval” – eh??
Done

ch02 p. 13 “For example, is an obstacle” – IF an obstacle
Done

ch02 p. 13 “no longer exists” – what no longer exists?
Done

ch02 p. 18 “We have verified that that are no aging effects” – that there
Done

ch02 p. 20 “that cage introduce in its motion” introduced maybe?
Done

ch02 p. 25 “For soft sticky obstacles” – he rest of the section refers to them as “sticky soft” obstacles
Done

ch02 p.25 “is non-monotonic with filling fraction” – does not appear to be grammatical, would usually read that the  increase or decrease not monotonic, not the quantity itself.
Done

3):
  ch06: "object-oriented" programming
  Done
