  abstract = {The study of biopolymers as dextran in aqueous solution, is effectively determined by intrinsic viscosity [{$\eta$}] measurements at different temperatures. Molecular weight (\emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{v}}) and hydrodynamic properties can be calculated from there. The Mark-Houwink parameters indicate the dependence with temperature (T) in the range from 20 to 50\textordmasculine{}C, ie with increasing T \emph{a} increases and\emph{ k}\textsubscript{\emph{M-H}} decreases. These hydrodynamic parameters show that these polysaccharides behave as a compact rigid sphere and contract by the increase of temperature\emph{ }(\emph{R}\textsubscript{\emph{H}} decreases) for the \emph{M}\textsubscript{\emph{w}} range from 8.8 to 200kDa.},
