\chapter{FG Nup aggregation under crowded conditions}\label{ch05}

While our bound-state diffusion model of selectivity is general enough to apply to many biofilters, we have been using the nuclear pore in particular as inspiration.  We predict that its selective properties arise from the continued mobility of transport factors while bound to FG Nups.  One mechanism of bound-state diffusion arises from the flexible, tether-like nature of the disordered Nups.  Such a mechanism is possible whether the Nups form a polymer brush or a transient hydrogel, so long as they remain sufficiently dynamic.

The exact conformation of Nups within the nuclear pore is unknown, due to the difficulty in imaging such a disordered system.  Some Nups, such as Nsp1, aggregate in buffer to form hydrogel structures \cite{frey06, frey07, ader10}, although evidence suggests it does not aggregate in the cellular environment \cite{hough15}.  Other Nups can form phase-separated liquid droplets \cite{schmidt15}.  Nup153 forms amyloid fibrils \textit{in vitro} (Fig.~\ref{fig:amyloid}B) at a rate which is increased by the addition of inert crowders \cite{milles13}.  Amyloid structures, as shown in in Fig.~\ref{fig:amyloid}A, are long chains of stacked $\beta$ sheets which are much less flexible and dynamic than individual disordered proteins, potentially limiting the effectiveness of the tethered bound diffusion of transport factors.  Amyoid fibrils are commonly formed by disordered proteins upon aggregation and are often implicated in disease \cite{jahn08}.    On the other hand, atomic force microscopy (AFM) data and simulations suggest that Nups in the nuclear pore remain highly dynamic \cite{sakiyama16,moussavi-baygi16}.

We decided to test the aggregation behavior of a fragment of the essential FG Nup Nsp1 known as FG124, described in Sec.~\ref{sec:Nups} and Appendix~\ref{appx:sequences}.  This 124-amino-acid peptide contains eight FG motifs and is known to aggregate in buffer over the course of several hours.  However, in-cell NMR shows it to remain disordered inside bacterial cells \cite{hough15}.  Given the disparity in aggregation behavior under these different conditions, we wanted to determine whether we could encourage or suppress aggregation and amyloid formation with our choice of crowding agents.

While the simplicity of studying aggregation of FG124 in buffer alone is appealing, the nuclear pore is a very different environment.  Cells are extremely crowded with proteins, nucleic acids, and other macromolecules.  Some estimate that macromolecules fill 30\% of a cell's volume \cite{breydo14}.  Crowding can have strong effects on a protein's behavior, sometimes in surprising ways.  Furthermore, crowding effects can differ depending on whether the crowders are inert, interacting, compact, extended, and so on.  Generally speaking, crowding seems to increase the rate of aggregation of disordered proteins, but this is by no means universal \cite{breydo15, breydo14,lee12,magno10,milles13}.  The presence of small crowders tends to encourage proteins to take on compact conformations due to the excluded volume effect, which in the case of IDPs often leads to aggregation.  However, the viscosity changes due to crowding may inhibit the formation of aggregates \cite{sleutel12,saha16}.  Other important but not well-understood factors include crowder structure and interactions, agitation or its absence, and the presence of an air-water interface \cite{lee12, breydo14}.

We studied FG124 aggregation in the presence of various crowding agents, both inert and nonspecifically interacting, using a number of techniques.  The kinetics were probed with a fluorescence aggregation assay, which showed significant differences between crowders.  Two inert crowders, poly(ethylene glycol) and polyvinylpyrrolidone, were chosen for further NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy.  Edit: put in a sentence here with major conclusions after talking to Loren.

\section{Fluorescence time courses}

In order to probe the aggregation kinetics of FG124, we incubated samples in the presence of crowders and thioflavin T (ThT), a dye which is sensitive to the presence of amyloids.  Over the course of several hours, FG124 aggregated and the fluorescence intensity from ThT increased.  By recording the intensity at 10-minute intervals, we were able to plot sigmoidal aggregation curves for the samples, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sigmoid-fit}.  These curves show a lag phase while the aggregates are nucleating, followed by a growth phase of rapid aggregation, ending in a plateau phase.  We recorded timecourses for multiple crowders, including inert crowders as well as nonspecifically binding ones, and analyzed the resulting aggregation parameters.  Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were chosen as representative inert crowders.  Cell lysate was used to imitate the cellular environment and test the effect of nonspecific interactions on FG124 aggregation.  Finally, serine was used as a crowder as previous work demonstrated that it caused Nsp1, the FG Nup from which FG124 is derived, to aggregate more quickly \cite{milles13}.  Many of the timecourse experiments were performed by Sophie Reskin and Paul Marchando, and Sophie also took part in the analysis.

Thioflavin T is a dye that grows much brighter when bound to amyloids.  Upon binding, its absorption maximum shifts from from 385 nm to 450 nm and it emission maximum from 445 nm to 482 nm \cite{picken12}.  Although ThT is a more reliable indicator of amyloids than other fluorescence methods, notably Congo red stain, it suffers from reproducibility problems.  There is no consensus on the mechanism of ThT binding to amyloids.  Some proposed mechanisms rely on the presence of ThT micelles, which form above a critical concentration of about 4 $\mu$M, while others advocate for avoiding micelles \cite{khurana05, groenning09}.  There is some evidence that amyloid fibrils can adsorb to the plastic surface of a multiwell plate, decreasing ThT fluorescence intensity as the fibrils mature \cite{murray13}.  Often in our timecourse experiments, the ThT fluorescence did reach a maximum and then decrease.  The fluorescence intensity also depends on the sample viscosity, an effect which we noticed in our timecourses \cite{sulatskaya10}.  Despite these challenges, thioflavin T is the most consistent dye for detecting the process of amyloid formation.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Buffers} Potassium transport buffer (PTB) (150 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM $\tx{MgCl}_2$) was used for all timecourse and NMR samples.

\subsubsection{FG124 preparation} His-tagged FG124 was expressed in \textit{E. coli} in the plasmid pRSF.  Cultures were grown in LB and  induced at 37$^\circ$C for 2-4 hr with 1 mM IPTG at OD 0.6-0.8.  Periplasmic matrix was removed prior to lysis.  Cells were then lysed via sonication and FG124 purified using TALON cobalt resin (Appendix~\ref{appx:protein-purification}).  All purification buffers were PTB with 7M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) and protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC).  The elution buffer also contained 250 mM imidazole.

\subsubsection{Timecourse preparation} Stocks of PEG (avg. MW 20 kDa, Sigma, Bio-Ultra) and PVP (avg. MW 40 kDa, Sigman) in PTB were prepared at 20 or 40\% w/v; L-serine (EMD Millipore Calbiochem) stocks were prepared at 30\% w/v.  PEG and serine were at pH 7; PVP was pH 7 or pH 5.  Lyophilized lysate was prepared by homogenizing BL21 DE3 Gold cells and spinning them down.  The supernatant was lyophilized in a decomposing ammonium bicarbonate buffer and resuspended in PTB to the desired concentration when needed.  A 10 mM stock solution of ThT in PTB was prepared and filtered no more than a week before the timecourse, stored at room temperature and protected from light.  Immediately prior to starting the timecourse, FG124 was desalted into PTB to remove the imidazole and GuHCl.  Samples were promptly prepared containing the appropriate percentage of crowder, a final concentration of 1-2 mg/mL FG124, and 200 uM thioflavin T.  All samples in the same timecourse had the same concentration of FG124, including the buffer sample, which contained no crowding agent.  Blanks were prepared with crowding agent and thioflavin T, but no FG124.  Samples were pipetted into black, flat-bottomed, clear-bottomed 96-well plates with 150 uL per replicate.  Each sample yielded four to six replicates.  Only one blank replicate was used per condition.  One negative control and corresponding blank were prepared per timecourse containing 7M GuHCl and no crowding agent but using the same protein sample as all other conditions.  Each well contained a 3mm-diameter glass or teflon bead.  The plate was sealed with a PCR seal and taken to a Safire II plate reader.  The fluoresence was measured from the bottom at 10-minute intervals with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm, emission wavelength of 482 nm, and 5 nm bandwidths.  The plate shoook orbitally at high speed between measurements and was held at a temperature of 30 degrees C.  The time between desalting and beginning the plate reader measurements was typically about an hour; the time of desalting was taken as $t=0$ for the purposes of calculating lag time. In parallel with the sample preparation, the concentration of the desalted FG124 was measured with a BCA assay.  Sophie Reskin helped to optimize this assay with reference to \cite{giehm10}.

\subsubsection{Timecourse analysis}

After carrying out the aggregation timecourse, the data were normalized and fit to a sigmoid function in order to extract aggregation lifetimes and lag times.

The data were first normalized to the blanks, which contained crowding agents but no protein.  In nearly all cases, the blank intensity remained steady over time, as expected.  In those cases, the mean blank intensity was subtracted from the corresponding data.  In cases where the blank intensity changed over time, it was subtracted pointwise from the data.

Then the normalized curves were fit to a sigmoid given by
\begin{equation}
I(t) = C + \frac{A}{1+\exp \left(-k(t-T_{1/2})\right)}
\label{eq:sig-fit}
\end{equation}
where $I(t)$ is the normalized fluoresence intensity as a function of time (Fig.~\ref{fig:sigmoid-fit}).  The aggregation dynamics are described by the rate $k$ and the half-time $T_{1/2}$, which reflects the time needed for the intensity to reach half of its asympotic value.  More descriptive than the half-time is the lag time $T_\ell$, calculated as
\begin{equation}
T_l = T_{1/2} - \frac{2}{k}
\end{equation}
and representing the duration of the lag phase \cite{arosio15}.  The lag time here is defined as the intersection of the tangent line of maximum slope of the growth phase with the flat background signal of the lag phase.  

The offset $C$ and final amplitude $A$ are less meaningful in this context, and less reliable.  The offset should in principle be $C=1$, as the fluorescence of the sample and its blank should be equal before aggregation has begun.   Experimentally, $C \sim$ 1-2, reaching a maximum near $C= 10$ for a few sample conditions.  While this may have been because sample aggregation had already begun, the long lag times of those conditions do not support that interpretation.  It is possible that the presence of the unaggregated protein caused a change in baseline fluorescent through an unknown mechanism.

The plateau phase asymptotes to an intensity given by $I_\infty=C+A$.  We found significant variation in $I_\infty$ for the same condition between timecourses, and the relative magnitudes of different conditions also varied between timecourses.  As seen in previous thioflavin T studies, higher viscosity tended to result in higher values of $I_\infty$. Therefore, we do not consider $I_\infty$ in our analysis, leaving the aggregation rate $k$ and lag time $T_\ell$ as parameters of interest.

Next we normalized once again to account for differences between timecourses.  It was impossible to hold the FG124 concentration exactly fixed between timecourses (lookup: make a table with Sophie's concentration info).   Within each timecourse, we averaged the fit parameters for all replicates of FG124 in buffer only and subtracted that average from each replicate of each crowding condition.

\subsection{Results}

The mean fit parameters and number of replicates for each crowder condition are shown in Table~\ref{table:crowder-params} and Fig.~\ref{fig:tht-all-conditions}.  For both the aggregation rate $k$ and lag time $T_\ell$, a one-factor ANOVA rejected at the $p=0.05$ level the null hypothesis that there was no difference between the means.  Two-tailed t-tests were then run comparing all conditions shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tht-all-conditions}.  The resulting $p$-values were below 0.05 except for those comparing no crowder to PVP (rate), no crowder to PEG (lag time), and serine to PVP (lag time).  All $p$-values are reported in Appendix~\ref{appx:p-values}.

%The final concentration of crowding agent was 19\% serine w/v, 13\% PEG, and 13\% PVP. 
% Lysate concentration varied between time courses and was in the 1-10 mg/mL range.

Several timecourses were run without crowders at varying pH.  Table~\ref{table:FG124-pH} shows the resulting fit parameters, given as lifetime $\tau = 1/k$ and lag time $T_\ell$.  Six replicates were run of each pH condition.  One-way ANOVAs fail to reject the null hypothesis at the $p=0.05$ level, suggesting that FG124 aggregation is not affected by pH in the range 5-8.

Two crowders, PEG and PVP, warranted special attention.  These inert crowders are commonly used interchangeably, but the results of timecourses containing 13\% PEG or PVP suggest that they may in fact affect FG124 differently (Fig.~\ref{fig:tht-all-conditions}).  In order to investigate any differences between PEG and PVP, timecourses were run with varying crowder concentrations and analyzed as before.  Mean parameter values are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:peg-pvp}.  Statistics are given in Appendix~\ref{appx:p-values} but do not strongly suggest differences between varying concentrations within the same crowder.

% The ANOVA for the PEG time constants gave $p=0.0024$ with the t-test showing differences between: buffer-25\% PEG, buffer-13\% PEG, and 25\% PEG-20\% PEG. The ANOVA for the PEG lag times was likewise significant with $p = 0.0102$.  The significant pairs were: buffer-25\% PEG, buffer-20\% PEG, buffer-5\% PEG, and 25\% PEG-13\% PEG.

%For PVP, there were no significant differences in the time constant.  For the lag time, after the ANOVA and t-tests, there were differences between: buffer and everything except 5\% PVP, 25\% PVP and everything but 20\% PVP, and 20\%PVP-13\% PVP.

%For both conditions, it looks roughly like the lag time increases with the crowder concentration, but given the large error bars, I wouldn't read too much into it.  The time constants don't follow any particular trend and are mostly indistinguishable anyway.

\subsection{Discussion}

The results of the FG124 aggregation timecourses were difficult to interpret.  The reproducibility of thioflavin T fluorescence assays is notoriously poor, and many timecourses were run with high variability in results.  Results became more reproducible once the protocol was modified to include a bead in each well, which seemed to assist with mixing during the shaking incubation between time points.  Only data taken after this change are included in this dataset.

The results indicate changes in both lag time and aggregation lifetime of FG124 as a result of changing crowder conditions.  The origin and magnitude of these changes is unclear.  We chose to target the crowders PEG and PVP for further investigation.  These crowders, while typically treated as interchangeable, behaved differently in during the fluorescence timecourses (Fig.~\ref{fig:tht-all-conditions}).  When added to FG124 at a final concentration of 13\% w/v, PEG reduced the aggregation rate below that of the no-crowder condition while PVP did not.  Conversely, the lag time of the PEG condition remained approximately that of the no-crowder condition, but the lag time of the PVP condition decreased.

It is possible that the differences in aggregation time between PEG and PVP come from changes in viscosity.  The two samples do have widely different viscosity, as measured by Steve Whitten.  A 13\% PEG solution in PTB has a dynamic viscosity of 15.87 mPa s, while that of a 13\% PVP solution in PTB is 7.34 mPa s.  Studies on aggregation of insulin or $\alpha$ synuclein show varying effects of viscosity.  Increasing viscosity has been shown to increase the lag time and decrease the aggregation rate \cite{saha16,sleutel12}.  However, other studies suggest that the behavior is nonmonotonic depending on viscosity and the aggregation propensity of the protein \cite{munishkina04, magno10}.  While 13\% PEG and PVP solutions have significantly different viscosities, both fall into what Munishkina et al. define as the ``high concentration'' regime where fibrillation rate is expected to decrease \cite{munishkina04}.  The trends shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:peg-pvp} roughly agree with the supposition that crowding effects decrease lag time and increase rate for moderate crowder concentrations but have the opposite effect as viscosity effects begin to dominate.

To further probe the origin of the differences in aggregation, we recorded NMR spectra for FSFG and fluorescence spectra for FG124 and FSFG in crowded PEG and PVP solutions.

\section{Fluorescence spectra}

An obvious potential difference between PEG and PVP as inert crowders is the presence of an aromatic ring in PVP (Fig.~\ref{fig:peg-pvp-struct}).  The phenylalanines of FG124 also possess an aromatic ring, making ring-stacking or other interactions with PVP more likely.  As the phenylalanines are also key to transport factor binding, it is important to understand their interactions with crowders.  The presence of the ring itself makes fluorescence spectroscopy a natural choice for probing the differences between PEG and PVP as crowders.  While protein fluorescence is typically dominated by tryptophan and then tyrosine fluorescence, these amino acids are absent from both FG124 and FSFG, leaving phenylalanine with the strongest fluorescent signal.  Fluoresecence spectra were therefore collected near phenylalanine's emission maximum from both fresh and aggregaged FG124 in PEG or PVP.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Sample preparation}
FG124 was purified as described above and in Appendix~\ref{appx:protein-purification} and stored in PTB with 7M GuHCl.  Immediately before use, 130 uL of 520 $\mu$M FG124 was desalted with a Zeba spin desalting column to remove the GuHCl.  The resulting stock was used in the crowder samples, which had a final concentration of 340 $\mu$M FG124. 

\subsubsection{Fluorescence spectra}
Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Photon Technology International QM-6 fluorimeter.  High concentrations of crowder were not possible due to background fluorescence, so samples containing 340 $\mu$M FG124 along with 5\% w/v PEG or PVP were tested, along with FG124 in PTB only.  Blanks consisting of crowder only, buffer only, water, and FSFG in buffer were measured as well.  FG124 samples were tested before aggregation (within two hours of GuHCl removal), allowed to incubate at room temperature overnight without shaking, and tested again after aggregation.  FG124 samples were visibly cloudy after overnight incubation.

A micro quartz UV cuvette with approximately 12 $\mu$L sample volume was used for all spectra.  Between runs, the cuvette was rinsed three times with ethanol and five times with deionized water, and the exterior gently blotted with ethanol.  When aggregated FG124 was used, it was necessary to first rinse the cuvette with 7M GuHCl, soak in 7M GuHCl for five minutes, and then follow the cleaning procedure above.

The fluorimeter was set to 4 nm excitation and emission slits and an excitation wavelength of 240 nm.  Emission spectra were recorded at 1 nm intervals and automatically averaged over two runs.  The PMT detector was set to 1000 V.

\subsubsection{Data processing}
Data were normalized by averaging over two separate spectra and subtracting the appropriate blank spectrum containing the relevant crowder and buffer but no protein.

\subsection{Results}
Unfortunately, both PEG and PVP presented obstacles to the collection of UV fluorescence spectra. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:crowder-prop}A, PEG displayed a prominent fluorescence peak centered at 320 nm.  This may have been due to impurities in the PEG source (lookupL did I ever try better PEG).  At low PEG concentrations, this peak was still small compared to that of FG124 (Fig.~\ref{fig:FG124-fresh-vs-agg}B) and could be subtracted from the signal.  However, the PEG peak limited the maximum concentration of crowder to 5\%.  PVP, on the contrary, did not display a large peak within the region of interest, but its absorbance is quite high from 240-280 nm (Fig.~\ref{fig:crowder-prop}B).  The high PEG absorbance suppresses the fluorescence signal from FG124 (Fig.~\ref{fig:FG124-fresh-vs-agg}C).  While more dramatic effects on the FG124 spectrum might be expected from higher concentrations, the limit of 5\% w/v does serve to minimize any viscosity effects.

Figure~\ref{fig:phe-comparison} compares the phenylalanine peaks in FSFG concat-1, fresh and aggregated FG124, and pure phenylalanine in water from \cite{prahl95}.  The phenylalanine peak slightly shifts toward longer wavelengths as the data progress from pure  phenylalanine to FSFG to fresh and aggregated FG124.  Additionally, a shoulder develops at longer wavelengths.

The PEG sample showed the largest difference upon aggregation, both in peak height and location.  In both crowder conditions, but not in the buffer condition, a small peak appears in the aggregated FG124 near 310 nm.

\subsection{Discussion}

Looking at phenylalanine fluorescence is weird because almost all proteins have tryptophans which dominate the signal, and if they don't they have tyrosines.  We don't have either of those.  People don't study the different electronic states of phenylalanine much at all.  But in analogy with tryptophan, probably something is changing about the environment that the phenylalanines are in when there are crowders and it aggregates.  I really don't know what to say here and it's all handwavy.  Tryptophan has a lot of states because it has two rings and so there are lots of spectral classes like in that reference.  Red-shifting the peaks generally means it's going to a less hydrophobic environment.  If it gets stuck in an aggregate then something else happens.  Our protein probably has something similar going on, but because nobody studies phenylalanine we don't really know what it is that's going on.  We wanted to learn more, though, so we used NMR to look at FSFG, which has lots of conveniently-repeating phenylalanines.

\section{NMR relaxation measurements}

NMR uses the magnetic relaxation of unpaired spins, found in atoms such as 1H, 15N, and 13C to probe the local chemical environment of those spins.  When applied to isotopically labeled proteins, NMR can provide information on protein-protein interactions, structure, and relaxation rates.  Measurements of the longitudinal ($R_1$) and transverse ($R_2$) relaxation rates of each residue give information about the relaxation of individual spins and the time for the collection of spins in a sample to go out of phase with each other, respectively.  In particular, $R_2$ (increases/decreases) when a residue is interacting strongly with its environment.

Kathryn Wall measured the relaxation rates of FSFG in 13\% w/v PEG or PVP.  While ideally FG124 would be used, its propensity towards aggregation makes NMR experiments, which take several hours at a minimum, impossible.  Despite its differences in aggregation behavior, FSFG is a useful proxy in this case.  FSFG and FG124 are of similar lengths, derived from the Nup Nsp1, and contain similar number of FG motifs (6 FSFG motifs and 8 varied FG motifs, respectively) (Appendix~\ref{appx:sequences}).  Given that we expect the crowders to particularly affect the phenylalanines, results from FSFG are likely a good estimate of FG124 behavior as well.

\subsection{Methods}

Isotopically-labeled, his-tagged 15N FSFG was expressed in BL21DE3 Gold cells in the pRSF plasmid (Kan resistant).  Cells were grown in 1 L LB after inoculation with 1:500 preculture until reaching an OD600 of 0.6-0.8.  Cells were then pelleted by centrifuging for 10 minutes at 4000g and resuspended in a total of 1 L M9 salts pH 7.4 (10x M9 salts: 62 g/L Na$_2$HPO$_4$, 30 g/L KH$_2$PO$_4$, 5 g/L NaCl).  After washing, cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1 L M9 minimal media with 15N ammonium chloride, and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 2-4 hours.  The periplasmic matrix was then removed and the FSFG purified as described in Appendix~\ref{appx:protein-purification}.

The NMR samples contained 13\% w/v of either PEG or PVP, 140 $\mu$M FSFG 15N, 10\% D$_2$O, 1\% 15 mM TSP, and 1\%, 1mM DSS in PTB.  Total sample volume was 336 $\mu$L.  Ideally the protein concentration would have been at least 300 $\mu$M, but the presence of the crowders reduced the available volume for protein.  An identical sample containing no crowders was also prepared.
