\chapter{FG Nup aggregation under crowded conditions}\label{ch05}

Disordered proteins are often prone to aggregation, often causing disease, and the aggregation behavior of FG Nups is important to understand.  It is not clear what the aggregation state of Nups is within the pore or how their aggregation might play into nuclear transport \cite{things}.  \textit{In vitro}, many Nups spontaneously aggregate into amyoids over the course of a few hours, but there is evidence that this aggregation does not happen in the cellular environment \cite{frey07, Loren's paper}.  We investigated aggregation behavoir of an aggregation-prone Nup fragment in a number of different crowders.  Inert crowders such as PEG and PVP help mimic the extremely crowded cellular environment, but they may interact different with the protein than nonspecifically-binding crowders such as cell lysate or BSA.  We wanted to understand how different crowders affected the aggregation properties of Nups.

We used a 124-amino-acid fragment of the Nup Nsp1.  The FG-repeat segment of Nsp1 contains an aggregation-resistant portion (used as the basis for the FSFG peptide) as well as one that aggregates in buffer over the course of a few hours.  This aggregation-prone portion is the basis of the FG124 peptide used in the following aggregation experiments.

We used aggregation timecourses with thioflavin T as a readout, as well as fluorimetry, NMR, and x-ray scattering.  Our conclusion is something about the phenylalanines and how they behave differently in when crowded with PEG than with PVP (which also has an aromatic ring).

\section{Fluorescence time courses}

In order to probe the aggregation dynamics of FG124, we incubated samples in the presence of crowders and thioflavin T (ThT), a dye which is sensitive to the presence of amyloids.  Over the course of several hours, FG124 aggregated and the fluorescence intensity from ThT increased.  By recording the intensity at 10-minute intervals, we were able to plot sigmoidal aggregation curves for the samples, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sigmoid-fit}.  These curves show a lag phase while the aggregates are nucleating, followed by a growth phase of rapid aggregation, ending in a plateau phase.  We recorded timecourses for multiple crowders, including inert crowders as well as nonspecifically binding ones, and analyzed the resulting aggregation parameters.  Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were chosen as representative inert crowders.  Cell lysate was used to imitate the cellular environment and test the effect of nonspecific interactions on FG124 aggregation.  Finally, serine was used as a crowder as previous work demonstrated that it caused Nsp1, the FG Nup from which FG124 is derived, to aggregate more quickly \cite{frey07}.  Many of the timecourse experiments were performed by Sophie Reskin and Paul Marchando, and Sophie also took part in the analysis.

Thioflavin T is a dye that grows much brighter when bound to amyloids.  Upon binding, its absorption maximum shifts from from 385 nm to 450 nm and it emission maximum from 445 nm to 482 nm \cite{picken12}.  Although ThT is a more reliable indicator of amyloids than other fluorescence methods, notably Congo red stain, it suffers from reproducibility problems.  There is no consensus on the mechanism of ThT binding to amyloids.  Some proposed mechanisms rely on the presence of ThT micelles, which form above a critical concentration of about 4 $\mu$M, while others advocate for avoiding micelles \cite{khurana05, groenning09}.  There is some evidence that amyloid fibrils can adsorb to the plastic surface of a multiwell plate, decreasing ThT fluorescence intensity as the fibrils mature \cite{murray13}.  Often in our timecourse experiments, the ThT fluorescence did reach a maximum and then decrease.  The fluorescence intensity also depends on the sample viscosity, an effect which we noticed in our timecourses \cite{sulatskaya10}.  Despite these challenges, thioflavin T is the most consistent dye for detecting the process of amyloid formation.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Buffers} Potassium transport buffer (PTB) (150 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM $\tx{MgCl}_2$) was used for all timecourse and NMR samples.

\subsubsection{FG124 preparation} His-tagged FG124 was expressed in \textit{E. coli} in the plasmid pRSF.  Cultures were grown in LB and  induced at 37$^\circ$C for 2-4 hr with 1 mM IPTG at OD 0.6-0.8.  Periplasmic matrix was removed prior to lysis.  Cells were then lysed via sonication and FG124 purified using TALON cobalt resin (Appendix~\ref{appx:protein-purification}).  All purification buffers were PTB with 7M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) and protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC).  The elution buffer also contained 250 mM imidazole.

\subsubsection{Timecourse preparation} Stocks of PEG (lookup) and PVP (lookups) in PTB were prepared at 20 or 40\% w/v; serine (lookup) stocks were prepared at 30\% w/v.  PEG and serine were at pH 7; PVP was pH 7 or pH 5.  Lyophilized lysate was prepared by homogenizing BL21 DE3 Gold cells and spinning them down.  The supernatant was lyophilized in a decomposing ammonium bicarbonate buffer and resuspended in PTB to the desired concentration when needed.  A 10 mM stock solution of ThT in PTB was prepared and filtered no more than a week before the timecourse, stored at room temperature and protected from light.  Immediately prior to starting the timecourse, FG124 was desalted into PTB to remove the imidazole and GuHCl.  Samples were promptly prepared containing the appropriate percentage of crowder, a final concentration of 1-2 mg/mL FG124, and 200 uM thioflavin T.  All samples in the same timecourse had the same concentration of FG124, including the buffer sample, which contained no crowding agent.  Blanks were prepared with crowding agent and thioflavin T, but no FG124.  Samples were pipetted into black, flat-bottomed, clear-bottomed 96-well plates with 150 uL per replicate.  Each sample yielded four to six replicates.  Only one blank replicate was used per condition.  One negative control and corresponding blank were prepared per timecourse containing 7M GuHCl and no crowding agent but using the same protein sample as all other conditions.  Each well contained a 3mm-diameter glass or teflon bead.  The plate was sealed with a PCR seal and taken to a Safire II plate reader.  The fluoresence was measured from the bottom at 10-minute intervals with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm, emission wavelength of 482 nm, and 5 nm bandwidths.  The plate shoook orbitally at high speed between measurements and was held at a temperature of 30 degrees C.  The time between desalting and beginning the plate reader measurements was typically about an hour; the time of desalting was taken as $t=0$ for the purposes of calculating lag time. In parallel with the sample preparation, the concentration of the desalted FG124 was measured with a BCA assay.

\subsubsection{Timecourse analysis}

After carrying out the aggregation timecourse, the data were normalized and fit to a sigmoid function in order to extract aggregation lifetimes and lag times.

The data were first normalized to the blanks, which contained crowding agents but no protein.  In nearly all cases, the blank intensity remained steady over time, as expected.  In those cases, the mean blank intensity was subtracted from the corresponding data.  In cases where the blank intensity changed over time, it was subtracted pointwise from the data.

Then the normalized curves were fit to a sigmoid given by
\begin{equation}
I(t) = C + \frac{A}{1+\exp \left(-k(t-T_{1/2})\right)}
\label{eq:sig-fit}
\end{equation}
where $I(t)$ is the normalized fluoresence intensity as a function of time (Fig.~\ref{fig:sigmoid-fit}).  The aggregation dynamics are described by the rate $k$ and the half-time $T_{1/2}$, which reflects the time needed for the intensity to reach half of its asympotic value.  More descriptive than the half-time is the lag time $T_\ell$, calculated as
\begin{equation}
T_l = T_{1/2} - \frac{2}{k}
\end{equation}
and representing the duration of the lag phase \cite{arosio15}.  The lag time here is defined as the intersection of the tangent line of maximum slope of the growth phase with the flat background signal of the lag phase.  

The offset $C$ and final amplitude $A$ are less meaningful in this context, and less reliable.  The offset should in principle be $C=1$, as the fluorescence of the sample and its blank should be equal before aggregation has begun.   Experimentally, $C \sim$ 1-2, reaching a maximum near $C= 10$ for a few sample conditions.  While this may have been because sample aggregation had already begun, the long lag times of those conditions do not support that interpretation.  It is possible that the presence of the unaggregated protein caused a change in baseline fluorescent through an unknown mechanism.

The plateau phase asymptotes to an intensity given by $I_\infty=C+A$.  We found significant variation in $I_\infty$ for the same condition between timecourses, and the relative magnitudes of different conditions also varied between timecourses.  As seen in previous thioflavin T studies, higher viscosity tended to result in higher values of $I_\infty$. Therefore, we do not consider $I_\infty$ in our analysis, leaving the aggregation rate $k$ and lag time $T_\ell$ as parameters of interest.

Next we normalized once again to account for differences between timecourses.  It was impossible to hold the FG124 concentration exactly fixed between timecourses (lookup: make a table with Sophie's concentration info).   Within each timecourse, we averaged the fit parameters for all replicates of FG124 in buffer only and subtracted that average from each replicate of each crowding condition.

\subsection{Results}

The mean fit parameters and number of replicates for each crowder condition are shown in Table~\ref{table:crowder-params} and Fig.~\ref{fig:tht-all-conditions}.  For both the aggregation rate $k$ and lag time $T_\ell$, a one-factor ANOVA rejected at the $p=0.05$ level the null hypothesis that there was no difference between the means.  Two-tailed t-tests were then run comparing all conditions shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tht-all-conditions}.  The resulting $p$-values were below 0.05 except for those comparing no crowder to PVP (rate), no crowder to PEG (lag time), and serine to PVP (lag time).  All $p$-values are reported in Appendix~\ref{appx:p-values}.

%The final concentration of crowding agent was 19\% serine w/v, 13\% PEG, and 13\% PVP. 
% Lysate concentration varied between time courses and was in the 1-10 mg/mL range.

Several timecourses were run without crowders at varying pH.  Table~\ref{table:FG124-pH} shows the resulting fit parameters, given as lifetime $\tau = 1/k$ and lag time $T_\ell$.  Six replicates were run of each pH condition.  One-way ANOVAs fail to reject the null hypothesis at the $p=0.05$ level, suggesting that FG124 aggregation is not affected by pH in the range 5-8.

Two crowders, PEG and PVP, warranted special attention.  These inert crowders are commonly used interchangeably, but the results of timecourses containing 13\% PEG or PVP suggest that they may in fact affect FG124 differently (Fig.~\ref{fig:tht-all-conditions}).  In order to investigate any differences between PEG and PVP, timecourses were run with varying crowder concentrations and analyzed as before.  Mean parameter values are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:peg-pvp}.  Statistics are given in Appendix~\ref{appx:p-values} but do not strongly suggest differences between varying concentrations within the same crowder.

% The ANOVA for the PEG time constants gave $p=0.0024$ with the t-test showing differences between: buffer-25\% PEG, buffer-13\% PEG, and 25\% PEG-20\% PEG. The ANOVA for the PEG lag times was likewise significant with $p = 0.0102$.  The significant pairs were: buffer-25\% PEG, buffer-20\% PEG, buffer-5\% PEG, and 25\% PEG-13\% PEG.

%For PVP, there were no significant differences in the time constant.  For the lag time, after the ANOVA and t-tests, there were differences between: buffer and everything except 5\% PVP, 25\% PVP and everything but 20\% PVP, and 20\%PVP-13\% PVP.

%For both conditions, it looks roughly like the lag time increases with the crowder concentration, but given the large error bars, I wouldn't read too much into it.  The time constants don't follow any particular trend and are mostly indistinguishable anyway.

\subsection{Discussion}

The results of the FG124 aggregation timecourses were difficult to interpret.  The reproducibility of thioflavin T fluorescence assays is notoriously poor, and many timecourses were run with high variability in results.  Results became more reproducible once the protocol was modified to include a bead in each well, which seemed to assist with mixing during the shaking incubation between time points.  Only data taken after this change are included in this dataset.

The results indicate changes in both lag time and aggregation lifetime of FG124 as a result of changing crowder conditions.  The origin and magnitude of these changes is unclear.  We chose to target the crowders PEG and PVP for further investigation.  These crowders, while typically treated as interchangeable, behaved differently in during the fluorescence timecourses (Fig.~\ref{fig:tht-all-conditions}).  When added to FG124 at a final concentration of 13\% w/v, PEG reduced the aggregation rate below that of the no-crowder condition while PVP did not.  Conversely, the lag time of the PEG condition remained approximately that of the no-crowder condition, but the lag time of the PVP condition decreased.

It's possible that the differences in aggregation time between PEG and PVP come from changes in viscosity.  The two samples do have widely different viscosity, as measured by Steve Whitten.  A 13\% PEG solution in PTB has a dynamic viscosity of 15.87 mPa s, while that of a 13\% PVP solution in PTB is 7.34 mPa s.  The literature doesn't entirely agree on what happens to aggregation as a function of viscosity, but what we see could be due to that change.  (lookup: Check in lab book where I have lit search notes.)

To probe the origin of the differences in aggregation, we recorded NMR and fluorescence spectra for FG124 and FSFG in crowded PEG and PVP solutions.

\section{Fluorescence spectra}
We hypothesized that the crowder-dependent difference in aggregation might arise from the aromatic ring in PVP, which could interact with the phenylalanine in FG124 in a ring-stacking interaction.  To test this idea, I collected emission spectra of fresh and aggregated FG124 in PEG and PVP crowders near the phenylalanine peak wavelength (see Fig. \ref{fig:FG124-fresh-vs-agg}). 
\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Sample preparation}
FG124 was purified as described above and in Appendix~\ref{appx:protein-purification} and stored in PTB with 7M GuHCl.  Immediately before use, 130 uL of 520 $\mu$M FG124 was desalted with a Zeba spin desalting column to remove the GuHCl.  The resulting stock was used in the crowder samples, which had a final concentration of 340 $\mu$M FG124. 

\subsubsection{Fluorescence spectra}
Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Photon Technology International QM-6 fluorimeter.  High concentrations of crowder were not possible due to background fluorescence, so samples containing 340 $\mu$M FG124 along with 5\% w/v PEG or PVP were tested, along with FG124 in PTB only.  Blanks consisting of crowder only, buffer only, water, and FSFG in buffer were measured as well.  FG124 samples were tested before aggregation (within two hours of GuHCl removal), allowed to incubate at room temperature overnight without shaking, and tested again after aggregation.  FG124 samples were visibly cloudy after overnight incubation.

A micro quartz UV cuvette with approximately 12 $\mu$L sample volume was used for all spectra.  Between runs, the cuvette was rinsed three times with ethanol and five times with deionized water, and the exterior gently blotted with ethanol.  When aggregated FG124 was used, it was necessary to first rinse the cuvette with 7M GuHCl, soak in 7M GuHCl for five minutes, and then follow the cleaning procedure above.

The fluorimeter was set to 4 nm excitation and emission slits and an excitation wavelength of 240 nm.  Emission spectra were recorded at 1 nm intervals and automatically averaged over two runs.  The PMT detector was set to 1000 V.

\subsubsection{Data processing}
Data were normalized by averaging over two separate spectra and subtracting the appropriate blank spectrum containing the relevant crowder and buffer but no protein.

\subsection{Results}
Unfortunately, both PEG and PVP presented obstacles to the collection of UV fluorescence spectra. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:crowder-prop}A, PEG displayed a prominent fluorescence peak centered at 320 nm.  This may have been due to impurities in the PEG source (lookupL did I ever try better PEG).  At low PEG concentrations, this peak was still small compared to that of FG124 (Fig.~\ref{fig:FG124-fresh-vs-agg}B) and could be subtracted from the signal.  However, the PEG peak limited the maximum concentration of crowder to 5\%.  PVP, on the contrary, did not display a large peak within the region of interest, but its absorbance is quite high from 240-280 nm (Fig.~\ref{fig:crowder-prop}B).  The high PEG absorbance suppresses the fluorescence signal from FG124 (Fig.~\ref{fig:FG124-fresh-vs-agg}C).  While more dramatic effects on the FG124 spectrum might be expected from higher concentrations, the limit of 5\% w/v does serve to minimize any viscosity effects.

Figure~\ref{fig:phe-comparison} compares the phenylalanine peaks in FSFG concat-1, fresh and aggregated FG124, and pure phenylalanine in water from \cite{prahl95}.  The phenylalanine peak slightly shifts toward longer wavelengths as the data progress from pure  phenylalanine to FSFG to fresh and aggregated FG124.  Additionally, a shoulder develops at longer wavelengths.

In both crowder conditions, but not in the buffer condition, a small peak appears in the aggregated FG124 near 310 nm.
