\section{The nuclear pore complex is a unique filter}
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) resides in the nuclear envelope of eukaryotes and regulates all macromolecular traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm.  The NPC is one of the largest protein complexes in the cell, at about 60 MDa in yeast and 120 MDa in humans \cite{beck17}.  As the regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport, the NPC must rapidly and specifically pass a wide array of macromolecules: transcription factors into the nucleus, and RNA into the cytoplasm.  Moreover, it must be robust to problems and able to accomodate mechanical strain as the nuclear envelope changes shape, and to passage large cargo.

A typical yeast cell has xx nuclear pores, each with a dimension of xx.  Human cells have about xx pores with xx dimensions.

There are about 30 different types of Nups, all present in multiple copy numbers.

These functions are accomplished through a structure with two main parts, both made of proteins known as nucloporins, or Nups: the scaffold Nups, which form a ringlike complex, and the FG Nups, which are disordered and fill the central channel created by the scaffold Nups.  Aside from the NPC itself, transport factors (TFs) are a class of proteins essential for selective transport.  The energetic cost of selectivity is captured in the Ran GTP/GDP cycle.

\subsection{Scaffold nucleoporins are ordered and form ringlike complexes.}
The nuclear pore itself is formed of scaffold Nups, which are ordered proteins that form ringlike complexes with eightfold symmetry \cite{beck17}.  There is an inner ring and two outer rings, the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings.  The outer rings are slightly larger.  The nuclear ring is on the side of the nucleus and includes the nuclear basket.  The cytoplasmic ring includes the cytoplasmic filaments, which are (probably?) disordered proteins extending out into the cytoplasm.

The eightfold symmetry of the pore arises from its modular nature.  Scaffold Nups form various stable subcomplexes, of which one of the most important is the Y-complex.  The Y-complex forms the inner ring; there are 32 copies of the complex per pore \cite{beck17}.  The rings themselves are relatively flexible, as they need to be in order to accomodate deformations of the nuclear envelope.  This flexibility is achieved in part by through short linear motifs (SLMs) which connect the subcomplexes to each other.

Recent cryo-EM studies have achieved unprecedented resolution of the scaffold Nups \cite{rout study, other EM study}.

% Scaffold Nups have very low turnover rates. \cite{knockenhauer16}

\subsection{FG nucleoporins are disordered and fill the central channel of the pore.}
The central channel of the pore is filled with disordered FG nucleoporins (FG Nups).  FG Nups typically consist of an ordered domain that anchors them to the wall of the channel, and an entirely disordered domain that extends into the channel.  As with all Nups, FG Nups have eightfold symmetry in the pore, and some of them are present in much higher copy number.

The disordered portion of every FG Nup contains phenylalanine- glycine (FG) motifs which 
bind to the hydrophobic binding pockets of transport factors.  While there are multiple binding motifs, all are short sequences which incorporate an FG repeat; for instance, FSFG, GLFG, and others. \cite{the rout paper I took that figure from}.  Each FG Nup contains x-x FG repeats, leading to an extremely high density of FG repeats within the pore.

Since the FG Nups are disordered, most conventional visualization techniques do not work.  When imaged over time or when several pores are imaged, the averaged results do not show the disordered portion of the FG Nups.  Cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography don't work.  Techniques such as NMR and very fast AFM can help gain insight into their conformationa ensembles \cite{Loren's papers, the AFM paper}.  Early research suggested that the FG Nups formed a central plug or "transporter", but more recent work suggests that there is no central structure, just disordered proteins (the AFM study from Lim or Lemke group). There is some evidence from simulations that the density of the FG Nups, as well as their charge density and hydrophobic properties, are not uniform along either the radial or axial directions \cite{some energy landscape things, some simulations}.  This may contribute to selective transport, although the pore still functioned with all of the asymmetric FG Nups removed.  Indeed, the NPC is remarkably robust to FG Nup deletion.  Over half of the mass of FG Nups can be removed without eliminating the selectivity barrier \cite{beck17}.

\subsection{Energy for selective transport is provided by the Ran cycle}
Selective transport requires an energy source, which in the case of the NPC is provided by the Ran cycle.  When a TF-cargo complex passes from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (nuclear import), it encounters a RanGTP on the nuclear side which binds to the TF and displaces the cargo.  Then the TF-RanGTP complex can collect a cargo destined for nuclear export, and this ternary complex can diffuse back through the NPC to the cytoplasm.  The protein RanGAP then hydrolyzes the RanGTP to RanGDP, disrupting the complex into its three original pieces.  Ultimately, the energy source for selective nuclear transport comes from the RanGTP-RanGDP gradient from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, a gradient which is maintained partially by NTF2, which carries RanGTP through the pore \cite{stanley17}.

\subsection{Transport factors}

Transport factors (TFs) are ordered proteins that carry cargo through the NPC.  While there are various types, they share several features in common, most notably the fact that all known transport factors have more than one hydrophobic binding pocket which binds to FG repeats.  In fact, many TFs have several binding pockets.  Likewise, the binding affinity between TFs and FG Nups remains unknown for most TFs.  Estimates of dissociation constant $K_D$ vary from nanomolar to millimolar, depending on the environment (cellular, buffer, etc.) in which the measurement is made \cite{things}. There are many types of TF, of which some of the most important are the importins and exportins (karyopherins), NTF2, and mRNA exporters.

The karyopherins (Kaps) are the most-studied family of TFs.  They are also known (in human cells?) as importins and exportins.  The twenty or so different Kaps are responsible for most nucleocytoplasmic transport \cite{kapinos17}.  Kaps typically consist of multiple HEAT repeats, a helical motif which conveys structural flexibility \cite{yoshimura16}.  Most Kaps bind their cargo directly via a nuclear localization signal (NLS, for nuclear import) or nuclear export signal (NES, for nuclear export).  NLS and NES are 5-7 amino acid tags found on cargo \cite{}.  However, Kap95? (importin $\beta$) uses the adaptor protein Kap60? (importin $\alpha$) to bind its cargo. In general, Kaps are on the order of 100 kDa in size, well above the passive permeability limit \cite{}. Kaps may contribute to the selectivity barrier.

Unlike the karyopherins, nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) does not transport a wide variety of cargo across the NPC.  Instead, NFT2 is focused on maintaining the Ran gradient needed for transport.  It transports 

I need to decide whether to call them transport factors (TFs) or nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) throughout my paper.  We exclusively call them TFs in my lab and a few other labs but I think NTR is more common in the field as a whole.  For now I will call them TFs.  TFs carry cargo in and out of the nucleus, through the NPC.  All known TFs have at least two sites that bind to the FG repeats on the Nups, and many have more than that (up to 10 or so, it's unclear).  The importins (called karyopherins in yeast, and I'm not sure whether exportins are also karyopherins) are a major set of transport factors.  They are 95 kDa or larger and do most of the carrying of proteins (I think).  They are formed from many HEAT repeats, which are flexible helical structures, and have many binding sites.  I didn't study these.  I studied NTF2, which is a much smaller protein.  It's a homodimer whose components are each 14 kDa, so it's a 28 kDa dimer.  Each dimer has one FG binding site.  NTF2 carries Ran through the nuclear pore.  I need a section about the Ran cycle, which means I actually need to understand the Ran cycle.  NTF2 is near the cutoff for passively crossing through the pore, but it still travels through at least 30 times faster than similarly-sized inert proteins.  I've also worked with domains of Mex67, which I think is an mRNA exporter.  I need to learn more about mRNA export, as well as transport of large cargo with multiple TFs bound at once.  TFs bind to cargo since cargo has a nuclear localization signal (for entering the nucleus, NLS) or a nuclear export signal (for leaving the nucleus, NES), which is a short peptide tag that binds to transport factors.

\section{IDPs are important}
I'm not sure whether this should be a section or subsection or where exactly it should go.  I want to give some broader context for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and their cellular functions.  IDPs play a role in phase separation.  Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins are also very important.  About 30\% of eukaryotic proteins are disordered or contain significant disordered regions.  Selectivity through weak, multivalent binding is a hallmark of disordered protein function.  IDPs can form ``fuzzy'' complexes or act as hubs, since they can often bind to multiple binding partners.  Some become ordered upon binding and some do not.  I don't know exactly what other cellular functions IDPs are involved in - signaling pathways, I think.
\section{Experimental observations} Should I have a separate section for computational studies, or include them in experimenal work?
\subsection{Passive permeability barrier}
There is a cutoff around 30 kDa where molecules stop being able to passively transit the pore at any appreciable rate.  Work from the Timney lab suggests that the passive permeability barrier is not a sharp cutoff, but broad.
\subsection{Single-molecule studies (Kinetics of transport?)}
Lots of people have done single-molecule studies of the NPC.  They need to use superresolution microscopy and can't really see more than the length of time that it takes to passage the pore.  They measure things like dwell time in the pore and the proportion of successful transit attempts.  Some of these studies lead to estimations of the transport kinetics, i.e. on and off rates for Nup and transport factor interactions.  Many of these come from SPR studies or stopped-flow anisotropy measurements.  The SPR measurements also lead to estimations of layer height compaction or extension when various TFs are flowed across a grafted monolayer of FG Nups.  These experiments can often result in contradictory data.  There are some good review articles for single-molecule studies, and also some of the techniques I've described here aren't single molecule.
\subsection{Effect of transport factors}
The presence of transport factors may make the selectivity barrier more robust.  SPR measurements as discussed above give estimates of layer compaction or extension, and populations of tight- or weak-binding TFs.  Other studies (?) suggest that crowding with TFs might help reduce non-specific interactions and increase the selectivity of transport.
\subsection{Permeability barrier/flux studies}
People have measured the flux through the pore in vitro and in vivo in various ways.  One group developed OSTR, where they seal an NPC to the pore of a membrane and measure fluorescence flux of TFs through that pore.  The Gorlich group (Ribbeck) have permeabilized cells and injected fluorescent transport factors and watched how long it took them to localize to the nucleus.  These measurements show selectivities of 20-150 (ish) fold flux of TFs as compared to inert proteins.
\subsection{Nup deletion, etc.}
Some people have deleted subsets of Nups to see which are necessary for transport.  I don't know much about these studies.  None of the asymmetric Nups are necessary.  I think that about half of the mass of Nups can be deleted without significant consquences to transport, showing how robust the NPC is.
\section{Theoretical models of the NPC}
Many theoretical models exist, both qualitative and quantitative.
\subsection{Entropic barrier model}
The entropic barrier model postulates that Nups remain disordered within the pore (should talk about experimental evidence for and against).  In this model, inert proteins are kept out of the pore through an entropic barrier, because their entry into the pore would restrict the possible conformations of the disordered Nups.  TFs can get into the pore, in contrast, because the binding energy offsets the entropic penalty.  This is one of the two main qualitative models of the pore, the other being the hydrogel or selective phase model.  The Rout lab supports this model.  I think most labs other than the Gorlich lab are beginning to support this model, but I'm not sure.
\subsection{Hydrogel model}
The hydrogel model is the other main qualitative NPC model.  The Gorlich group supports this model.  This model postulates that the Nups interact via their FG motifs (discuss evidence in previous section, maybe?) and form a hydrogel.  A dynamic hydrogel.  Inert proteins are kept from passing through because they can't get through the gel mesh, but transport factors disrupt the crosslinks by binding to FGs and "melt" through.
\subsection{“Forest”/intermediate models}
This model proposes that a mix of the entropic barrier model and selective phase model are at play.
\subsection{Effect of crowding}
Some people (Zilman paper, etc) have modeled the effect of crowding on the selectivity barrier.  A lot of overlap with effect of transport factors.
\subsection{Effect of transport factors}
Same as previous section sort of.  Kap-centric models of the NPC (short for karyopherin-centric, for the class of TFs called karyopherins) propose that a permanent population of Kaps lives within the NPC.  This strengthens the selectivity barrier.
\subsection{Energy landscape models}
Most quantitative models of the nuclear pore are energy landscape models.  These are typically computational studies that require a fair amount of detail and assumptions about the pore.  They incorporate effects of charge, hydrophobicity, specific binding interactions, etc.  Generally the result is a picture of the free energy landscape encountered by TFs and by inert proteins as the travel along the axis of the pore.
\section{Synthetic NPCs}
Many different groups have attempted to make synthetic nuclear pore complexes, but they are generally not very successful.
\subsection{Gold nanopores (Rout group)}
One of Loren's colleagues in New York grafted FG Nups onto a gold-coated nanopore and monitored flux through the pore.  She saw low (less than 10-fold) selectivity.  I'm not sure whether other nanopore-based approaches have been tried.
\subsection{Hydrogels (Gorlich)}
The Gorlich group keeps making hydrogels out of Nups and testing the entry of various proteins.  They take Nsp1 or fragments of it or other Nups that spontaneously form hydrogels in buffer, and let them form a gel.  Then they introduce fluorescently-tagged TFs and inert proteins and monitor the progression of the fluorescent front into the gel.  They see very high (100 or more) partition coefficients, indicating that the TFs really bind very strongly to the gel.  They do not see rapid exit from the gel as would be required for rapid transport.
\subsection{Other models (peptide hydrogels, DNA origami, etc)}
There are a grab-bag of other models that I need to learn more about.  Some groups have done similar things to what we want to do, making hydrogels out of non-aggregating Nup peptides and a pentameric crosslinking domain.  There was a group that made an NPC ring out of DNA origami and attached Nups at particular points, though I'm not sure how that can be used to test selectivity because I can't see how to anchor the rings into a membrane.
\section{Conclusions of introduction?}
NPCs are interesting and important.
