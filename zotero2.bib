  abstract = {To date, optical lithography has been extensively used for in situ patterning of hydrogel structures in a scale range from hundreds of microns to a few millimeters. The two main limitations which prevent smaller feature sizes of hydrogel structures are (1) the upper glass layer of a microchip maintains a large spacing (typically 525 {$\mu$}m) between the photomask and hydrogel precursor, leading to diffraction of UV light at the edges of mask patterns, (2) diffusion of free radicals and monomers results in irregular polymerization near the illumination interface. In this work, we present a simple approach to enable the use of optical lithography to fabricate hydrogel arrays with a minimum feature size of 4 {$\mu$}m inside closed microchips. To achieve this, we combined two different techniques. First, the upper glass layer of the microchip was thinned by mechanical polishing to reduce the spacing between the photomask and hydrogel precursor, and thereby the diffraction of UV light at the edges of mask patterns. The polishing process reduces the upper layer thickness from {$\sim$}525 to {$\sim$}100 {$\mu$}m, and the mean surface roughness from 20 to 3 nm. Second, we developed an intermittent illumination technique consisting of short illumination periods followed by relatively longer dark periods, which decrease the diffusion of monomers. Combination of these two methods allows for fabrication of 0.4 \texttimes{} 106 sub-10 {$\mu$}m sized hydrogel patterns over large areas (cm2) with high reproducibility ({$\sim$}98.5\% patterning success). The patterning method is tested with two different types of photopolymerizing hydrogels: polyacrylamide and polyethylene glycol diacrylate. This method enables in situ fabrication of well-defined hydrogel patterns and presents a simple approach to fabricate 3-D hydrogel matrices for biomolecule separation, biosensing, tissue engineering, and immobilized protein microarray applications.},

The derivation is completely analytical and can provide an excellent tool for planning and analysis of FCS experiments. The dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio on different measurement conditions is extensively studied. We find that in addition to the shot noise and the noise associated with correlated molecular dynamics there is another source of noise that appears at very large lag times. We call this the ``particle noise,'' as its behavior is governed by the number of particles that have entered and left the laser beam sample volume during large dwell times. The standard deviations of all the points on the correlation function are calculated analytically and shown to be in good agreement with experiments. We have also investigated the bias associated with experimental correlation function measurements. A ``phase diagram'' for FCS experiments is constructed that demonstrates the significance of the bias for any given experiment. We demonstrate that the value of the bias can be calculated and added back as a first-order correction to the experimental correlation function.},

  abstract = {In this work, a novel thiol-ene based photopolymerizable resin formulation was shown to exhibit highly desirable characteristics, such as low cure time and the ability to overcome oxygen inhibition, for the photolithographic fabrication of microfluidic devices. The feature fidelity, as well as various aspects of the feature shape and quality, were assessed as functions of various resin attributes, particularly the exposure conditions, initiator concentration and inhibitor to initiator ratio. An optical technique was utilized to evaluate the feature fidelity as well as the feature shape and quality. These results were used to optimize the thiol-ene resin formulation to produce high fidelity, high aspect ratio features without significant reductions in feature quality. For structures with aspect ratios below 2, little difference (\&lt;3\%) in feature quality was observed between thiol-ene and acrylate based formulations. However, at higher aspect ratios, the thiol-ene resin exhibited significantly improved feature quality. At an aspect ratio of 8, raised feature quality for the thiol-ene resin was dramatically better than that achieved by using the acrylate resin. The use of the thiol-ene based resin enabled fabrication of a pinched-flow microfluidic device that has complex channel geometry, small (50 {$\mu$}m) channel dimensions, and high aspect ratio (14) features.},

  abstract = {Single-file diffusion is a ubiquitous physical process exploited by living and synthetic systems to exchange molecules with their environment. It is paramount to quantify the escape time needed for single files of particles to exit from constraining synthetic channels and biological pores. This quantity depends on complex cooperative effects, whose predominance can only be established through a strict comparison between theory and experiments. By using colloidal particles, optical manipulation, microfluidics, digital microscopy, and theoretical analysis we uncover the self-similar character of the escape process and provide closed-formula evaluations of the escape time. We find that the escape time scales inversely with the diffusion coefficient of the last particle to leave the channel. Importantly, we find that at the investigated microscale, bias forces as tiny as 10(-15) N determine the magnitude of the escape time by drastically reducing interparticle collisions. Our findings provide crucial guidelines to optimize the design of micro-and nanodevices for a variety of applications including drug delivery, particle filtering, and transport in geometrical constrictions.},

  abstract = {Proteins are translated in the cytoplasm, but many need to access the nucleus to perform their functions. Understanding how these nuclear proteins are transported through the nuclear envelope and how the import processes are regulated is therefore an important aspect of understanding cell function. Structural biology has played a key role in understanding the molecular events during the transport processes and their regulation, including the recognition of nuclear targeting signals by the corresponding receptors. Here, we review the structural basis of the principal nuclear import pathways and the molecular basis of their regulation. The pathways involve transport factors that are members of the beta-karyopherin family, which can bind cargo directly (e.g., importin-beta, transportin-1, transportin-3, importin-13) or through adaptor proteins (e.g., importin-alpha, snurportin-1, symportin-1), as well as unrelated transport factors such as Hikeshi, involved in the transport of heat-shock proteins, and NTF2, involved in the transport of RanGDP. Solenoid proteins feature prominently in these pathways. Nuclear transport factors recognize nuclear targeting signals on the cargo proteins, including the classical nuclear localization signals, recognized by the adaptor importin-alpha, and the PY nuclear localization signals, recognized by transportin-1. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, constitute key regulatory mechanisms operating in these pathways. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which in yeast is a {$\sim$}50 MDa complex consisting of {$\sim$}30 different proteins. Small molecules can freely exchange through the NPC, but macromolecules larger than {$\sim$}40 kDa must be aided across by transport factors, most of which belong to a related family of proteins termed karyopherins (Kaps). These transport factors bind to the disordered phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domains in a family of NPC proteins termed FG nups, and this specific binding allows the transport factors to cross the NPC. However, we still know little in terms of the molecular and kinetic details regarding how this binding translates to selective passage of transport factors across the NPC. Here we show that the specific interactions between Kaps and FG nups are strongly modulated by the presence of a cellular milieu whose proteins appear to act as very weak competitors that nevertheless collectively can reduce Kap/FG nup affinities by several orders of magnitude. Without such modulation, the avidities between Kaps and FG nups measured in vitro are too tight to be compatible with the rapid transport kinetics observed in vivo. We modeled the multivalent interactions between the disordered repeat binding sites in the FG nups and multiple cognate binding sites on Kap, showing that they should indeed be sensitive to even weakly binding competitors; the introduction of such competition reduces the availability of these binding sites, dramatically lowering the avidity of their specific interactions and allowing rapid nuclear transport.},

  abstract = {Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) mediates nuclear import of RanGDP, a central component of many nuclear trafficking pathways. NTF2 is a homodimer and each chain has independent binding sites for RanGDP and nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) that contain FxFG sequence repeats. We show here that the monomer-dimer dissociation constant for NTF2 obtained by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation is in the micromolar range, indicating that a substantial proportion of cellular NTF2 may be monomeric. To investigate the functional significance of NTF2 dimerization, we engineered a series of point mutations at the dimerization interface and one of these (M118E) remained monomeric below concentrations of 150 {$\mu$}M. CD spectra and X-ray crystallography showed that M118E-NTF2 preserved the wild-type NTF2 fold, although its thermal stability was 20 deg. C lower than that of the wild-type. M118E-NTF2 bound both RanGDP and FxFG nucleoporins less strongly, suggesting that dissociation of the NTF2 dimer could facilitate RanGDP release and thus nucleotide exchange after it had been transported into the nucleus. Moreover, colloidal gold coated with M118E-NTF2 showed reduced binding to Xenopus oocyte nuclear pores. Overall, our results indicate that dimer formation is important for NTF2 function and give insight into the formation of heterodimers by mRNA export factors such as TAP1 and NXT1 that contain NTF2-homology domains.},

Laser-induced fluorescence is used as a specific highly sensitive probe of concentration, permitting the analysis of the characteristic time dependence of spontaneous concentration fluctuations. We present here a quantitative analysis of the statistical and systematic errors inherent in such an experiment. Theoretical expressions are derived for the signal-to-noise ratio for various operational definitions of the photocount correlation signal. It is shown that the critical parameter governing the statistical accuracy of the experiment is not the total number of photocounts per correlation time, but (when background fluorescence is negligible) the photocounts per correlation time, per fluorescent molecule, a parameter independent of the number of fluorescent molecules in the sample volume. Comparisons are made with parallel results for laser-light scattering experiments derived by other authors. Finally, we consider the effects of background fluorescence, photolysis, and other deviations from ideality.},

Salts and polyanionic polymers do not significantly improve the quality of the assay. However, an orbital agitation mode in the plate reader is a crucial first step toward reproducible {$\alpha$}SN fibrillization. Higher reproducibility is achieved by the addition of glass beads, as evaluated by the percentage standard deviation of the nucleation and elongation rate constants and the end-stage fluorescence intensity of the fibril-binding dye thioflavin T (ThT). The highest reproducibility is obtained by either seeding the solution with preformed fibrils or by adding submicellar amounts of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), where we obtain percentage standard deviations of 3\textendash{}4\% on the end ThT level. We conclude that there are multiple ways to achieve satisfactory levels of reproducibility, although the different conditions used to induce aggregation may lead to different fibrillization pathways.},

In addition, we carried out Brownian dynamics simulations to model the experimental conditions. Good agreement between experimental and simulation results has been obtained regarding the slow-down factor. Fickian diffusion is predicted and seen in almost all experimental systems, while apparent non-Fickian exponents that show up for two strongly confined systems are attributed to polydispersity of the cavity openings.

Nuclear trafficking involves a complex series of interactions between cargo, soluble transport factors (carriers) and nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) that are orchestrated by the Ras-family GTPase Ran. The primary role of Ran is probably to establish directionality and to sort molecules to be transported by controlling the interaction between carriers and cargoes, so that they bind in one compartment but dissociate in the other. Translocation of carriers and cargo-carrier complexes through NPCs requires interactions between the carriers and nucleoporins that contain distinctive tandem sequence repeats based on cores rich in glycine and phenylalanine residues that are separated by hydrophilic linkers. Much recent work has focused on these interactions and, in particular, their specificity, regulation and function. Evidence is accumulating that carriers move through the NPC by distinct but overlapping routes using specific subsets of nucleoporins.},

Here we provide a treatment of FRAP recovery for a molecule undergoing a combined process of reversible membrane association and lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane for two commonly used bleach geometries: stripes, and boxes. Such analysis is complicated by the fact that diffusion of a molecule during photobleaching can lead to broadening of the bleach area, resulting in significant deviations of the actual bleach shape from the desired bleach geometry, which creates difficulty in accurately measuring kinetic parameters. Here we overcome the problem of deviations between actual and idealized bleach geometries by parameterizing, more accurately, the initial postbleach state. This allows for reconstruction of an accurate and analytically tractable approximation of the actual fluorescence distribution. Through simulated FRAP experiments, we demonstrate that this method can be used to accurately measure a broad range of combinations of diffusion constants and exchange rates. Use of this method to analyze the plextrin homology domain of PLC-{$\delta$}1 in Caenorhabditis elegans results in quantitative agreement with prior analysis of this domain in other cells using other methods. Because of the flexibility, relative ease of implementation, and its use of standard, easily obtainable bleach geometries, this method should be broadly applicable to investigation of protein dynamics at the plasma membrane.},

Ulp1p is localized primarily at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) through interactions involving the karyopherins Kap121p and Kap95p\textendash{}Kap60p heterodimer and a subset of nuclear pore-associated proteins. The sequestration of Ulp1p at the nuclear periphery is crucial for the proper control of protein desumoylation. To gain insights into the role of the karyopherins in regulating the localization of Ulp1p, we have determined the crystal structures of Kap121p and Kap60p bound to the N-terminal non-catalytic domain of Ulp1p that is necessary and sufficient for NPC targeting. Contrary to a previous proposal that Ulp1p is tethered to the transport channel of the NPC through unconventional interactions with the karyopherins, our structures reveal that Ulp1p has canonical nuclear localization signals (NLSs): (1) an isoleucine-lysine-NLS (residues 51\textendash{}55) that binds to the NLS-binding site of Kap121p, and (2) a classical bipartite NLS (residues 154\textendash{}172) that binds to the major and minor NLS-binding sites of Kap60p. Ulp1p also binds Kap95p directly, and the Ulp1p\textendash{}Kap95p binding is enhanced by the importin-{$\beta$}-binding domain of Kap60p. GTP-bound Gsp1p (the yeast Ran ortholog) and the exportin Cse1p cooperate to release Ulp1p from the karyopherins, indicating that the stable sequestration of Ulp1p to the NPC would require a karyopherin-independent mechanism to anchor Ulp1p at the NPC.},

  abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) gate the only conduits for nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotes. Their gate is formed by nucleoporins containing large intrinsically disordered domains with multiple phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG domains). In combination, these are hypothesized to form a structurally and chemically homogeneous network of random coils at the NPC center, which sorts macromolecules by size and hydrophobicity. Instead, we found that FG domains are structurally and chemically heterogeneous. They adopt distinct categories of intrinsically disordered structures in non-random distributions. Some adopt globular, collapsed coil configurations and are characterized by a low charge content. Others are highly charged and adopt more dynamic, extended coil conformations. Interestingly, several FG nucleoporins feature both types of structures in a bimodal distribution along their polypeptide chain. This distribution functionally correlates with the attractive or repulsive character of their interactions with collapsed coil FG domains displaying cohesion toward one another and extended coil FG domains displaying repulsion. Topologically, these bipartite FG domains may resemble sticky molten globules connected to the tip of relaxed or extended coils. Within the NPC, the crowding of FG nucleoporins and the segregation of their disordered structures based on their topology, dimensions, and cohesive character could force the FG domains to form a tubular gate structure or transporter at the NPC center featuring two separate zones of traffic with distinct physicochemical properties.},

Gene regulation is a key component of biological activity regulation in the cell. Transcription factors control the expression levels of various genes that are necessary for the maintenance or conversion of cellular states during animal development. Because transcription factor activities determine the extent of transcription of target genes, the number of active transcription factors must be tightly regulated. In this regard, the nuclear translocation of a transcription factor is an important determinant of its activity. Therefore, it is becoming clear that the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery is involved in cell differentiation and organism development.

We find that cross-linker density controls the droplet shape and deformation timescales, consistent with a variable interfacial tension and viscosity. Near the liquid\textendash{}solid transition, cross-linked actin bundles show behaviors reminiscent of fluid threads, including capillary instabilities and contraction. These data reveal a liquid droplet phase of actin, demixed from the surrounding solution and dominated by interfacial tension.

Microsphere formation involved dispersing a lipophilic marker dissolved in soybean oil into an alginate solution containing insoluble calcium carbonate microcrystals. The dispersion was then emulsified in silicone oil to form an O/W/O multiple phase emulsion. Addition of an oil soluble acid released calcium from carbonate complex for gelation of the alginate. Chitosan was then applied as a membrane coat to increase the mechanical strength and stabilize the microspheres in simulated intestinal media. Parameters studied included encapsulation yield, alginate concentration, chitosan molecular weight and membrane formation time. Mean diameters ranging from 500 to 800 {$\mu$}m and encapsulation yields ranging from 60 to 80\% were obtained. Minimal marker release was observed under simulated gastric conditions, and rapid release was triggered by transfer into simulated intestinal fluid. Higher overall levels of release were obtained with uncoated microspheres, possibly due to binding of marker to the chitosan membrane coat. However the slower rate of release from coated microspheres was felt better suited as a delivery vehicle for oil soluble drugs.},

Indeed, thiol\textendash{}ene chemistry presents interesting features that are particularly attractive for platforms requiring specific reactions of peptides or proteins, in particular, in situ, during cell culture or encapsulation. Despite such interest, little is known about the factors impacting thiol\textendash{}ene chemistry in situ, under biologically relevant conditions. Here we explore some of the molecular parameters controlling photoinitiated thiol\textendash{}ene couplings with a series of alkenes and thiols, including peptides, in buffered conditions. 1H NMR and HPLC were used to quantify the efficiency of couplings and the impact of the pH of the buffer, as well as the molecular structure and local microenvironment close to alkenes and thiols to be coupled. Some of these observations are supported by molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics calculations. An important finding of our work is that the pKa of thiols (and its variation upon changes in molecular structure) have a striking impact on coupling efficiencies. Similarly, positively charged and aromatic amino acids are found to have some impact on thiol\textendash{}ene couplings. Hence, our study demonstrates that molecular design should be carefully selected in order to achieve high biofunctionalization levels in biomaterials with peptides or promote the efficient formation of peptide-based hydrogels.},

  abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes are fundamental components of all eukaryotic cells that mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Determining their 110-megadalton structure imposes a formidable challenge and requires in situ structural biology approaches. Of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), 15 are structured and form the Y and inner-ring complexes. These two major scaffolding modules assemble in multiple copies into an eight-fold rotationally symmetric structure that fuses the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form a central channel of \textasciitilde{}60 nm in diameter. The scaffold is decorated with transport-channel Nups that often contain phenylalanine-repeat sequences and mediate the interaction with cargo complexes. Although the architectural arrangement of parts of the Y complex has been elucidated, it is unclear how exactly it oligomerizes in situ. Here we combine cryo-electron tomography with mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis, perturbation experiments and structural modelling to generate, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to date. Our data suggest previously unknown protein interfaces across Y complexes and to inner-ring complex members. We show that the transport-channel Nup358 (also known as Ranbp2) has a previously unanticipated role in Y-complex oligomerization. Our findings blur the established boundaries between scaffold and transport-channel Nups. We conclude that, similar to coated vesicles, several copies of the same structural building block\textemdash{}although compositionally identical\textemdash{}engage in different local sets of interactions and conformations.},

  abstract = {The overall effects of oxygen on thiol\textendash{}acrylate photopolymerizations were characterized. Specially, the choice of thiol monomer chemistry, functionality, and concentration on the extent of oxygen inhibition were considered. As thiol concentration was increased, the degree of oxygen inhibition was greatly reduced because of chain transfer from the peroxy radical to the thiol. When comparing the copolymerization of 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate with the alkane-based thiol (1,6-hexane dithiol) to the copolymerization with the propionate thiol (glycol dimercaptopropionate), it was found that the propionate system was much more reactive and polymerized to a greater extent in the presence of oxygen. In addition, the functionality was considered where the glycol dimercaptopropionate was compared to a tetrafunctional propionate of similar chemistry (pentaerythritol tetrakis(mercaptopropionate)). Given the same thiol concentration, the higher functionality thiol imparted a faster polymerization rate, due to the increased polymer system viscosity, which limited oxygen diffusion and decreased the extent of overall oxygen inhibition. Thus, preliminary insight is provided into how thiol monomer choice affects the extent of oxygen inhibition in thiol\textendash{}acrylate photopolymerization. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that mechanical deformation of the cell nucleus regulates the nuclear import of the transcriptional activators of genes involved in primary physiological cell responses such as stem cell differentiation. In addition, this nuclear mechanosensing response is de-regulated in pathological states, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. One hypothesis that could greatly advance the field is that the deformation of the nuclear envelope activates nuclear pore complexes through a direct mechanical link. The understanding of this possible mechanism for nuclear pore complex stretch-activation entails studying the mechanical connection of this complex to the nuclear envelope at the nanoscale. The nanomechanics of the nuclear pore complex is thus emerging as a novel research field, bridging nanoscience with nanotechnology. This review examines the frontier of research methodologies that are potentially useful for building a computational model of this interaction. This includes, for example, electron tomography to assess the geometrical features of the nuclear pore complex and nanoindentation to estimate its mechanical properties and that of the nuclear envelope.

  doi = {10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.07.033},
  abstract = {Background
The 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) participates in regulating the homeostasis of cellular proteins and was considered one of the key chaperones involved in the control and regulation of amyloid deposits. Hsp90 interacts with the amyloid protein tau through tau aggregation-prone regions, including the VQIVYK hexapeptide motif. This hexapeptide, which self-aggregates, forming amyloid fibrils, is widely used to model amyloid formation mechanisms. Despite evidence showing that Hsp90 interacts directly with Ac-VQIVYK-NH2, its role in the hexapeptide fibrillation process and its binding to peptide structures have not yet been determined.
Methods
Various biochemical and biophysical techniques, including ultracentrifugation, spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, and electron microscopy, were employed to assess the effects of Hsp90 on Ac-VQIVYK-NH2 assembly and disassembly processes.
Results
At sub-stoichiometric concentrations, Hsp90 bound directly to Ac-VQIVYK-NH2 amyloid structures in vitro, with each Hsp90 dimer interacting with an amyloid structure made of around 50 hexapeptide subunits. Hsp90 inhibited Ac-VQIVYK-NH2 assembly by increasing the critical concentrations of Ac-VQIVYK-NH2 required for assembly. Hsp90 also inhibited the disassembly of Ac-VQIVYK-NH2 amyloid fibrils and promoted their rescue.
Conclusions
A model explaining the dual effect of Hsp90 on the Ac-VQIVYK-NH2 amyloid fibrillation process has been proposed.
General significance
These in vitro results provide new insights into the possible roles of molecular chaperones in modulating amyloid structures by limiting the spread of toxic species.},

  abstract = {Nucleocytoplasmic transport has been the subject of a large body of research in the past few decades. Recently, the focus of investigations in this field has shifted from studies of the overall function of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to the examination of the role of different domains of phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporin (FG Nup) sequences on the NPC function. In our recent bioinformatics study, we showed that FG Nups have some evolutionarily conserved sequence-based features that might govern their physical behavior inside the NPC. We proposed the 'like charge regions' (LCRs), sequences of charged residues with only one type of charge, as one of the features that play a significant role in the formation of FG network inside the central channel. In this study, we further explore the role of LCRs in the distribution of FG Nups, using a recently developed coarse-grained molecular dynamics model. Our results demonstrate how LCRs affect the formation of two transport pathways. While some FG Nups locate their FG network at the center of the NPC forming a homogeneous meshwork of FG repeats, other FG Nups cover the space adjacent to the NPC wall. LCRs in the former group, i.e. FG Nups that form an FG domain at the center, tend to regulate the size of the highly dense, doughnut-shaped FG meshwork and leave a small low FG density area at the center of the pore for passive diffusion. On the other hand, LCRs in the latter group of FG Nups enable them to maximize their interactions and cover a larger space inside the NPC to increase its capability to transport numerous cargos at the same time. Finally, a new viewpoint is proposed that reconciles different models for the nuclear pore selective barrier function.},

Here we tested the suitability of proteolytically degradable synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels as an ECM model system for cell migration research and compared this designer matrix with the two well-established ECM mimetics fibrin and collagen. Three-dimensional migration of dermal fibroblasts was quantified by time-lapse microscopy and automated single-cell tracking. A broadband matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a potent MMP-inducer in fibroblasts, were used to alter MMP regulation. We demonstrate a high sensitivity of migration in synthetic networks to both MMP modulators: inhibition led to an almost complete suppression of migration in PEG hydrogels, whereas MMP upregulation increased the fraction of migrating cells significantly. Conversely, migration in collagen and fibrin proved to be less sensitive to the above MMP modulators, as their fibrillar architecture allowed for MMP-independent migration through preexisting pores. The possibility of molecularly recapitulating key functions of the natural extracellular microenvironment and the improved protease sensitivity makes PEG hydrogels an interesting model system that allows correlation between protease activity and cell migration.},

Several differing models for their dynamics within the pore have been proposed. We characterize the behavior of the FG nucleoporins in~vivo using polarized fluorescence microscopy. Using nucleoporins tagged with green fluorescent protein along their FG domains, we show that some of these proteins are ordered, indicating an overall orientational organization within the NPC. This orientational ordering of the FG domains depends on their specific context within the NPC, but is independent of active transport and cargo load. For most nups, behavior does not depend on the FG motifs. These data support a model whereby local geometry constrains the orientational organization of the FG nups. Intriguingly, homologous yeast and mammalian proteins show conserved behavior, suggesting functional relevance. Our findings have implications for mechanistic models of NPC transport.},

However, simulations have shown that this rotational symmetry can be broken when there are attractive interactions between the polymers. We investigate the phases that emerge in these circumstances, and we quantify the effect of the symmetry assumption on the phase behavior of the system. In the absence of this assumption, one can observe large differences in the equilibrium densities between the rotationally symmetric case and the non-rotationally symmetric case. A simple analytical model is developed that illustrates the driving thermodynamic forces responsible for this symmetry breaking.

Unexpectedly, we deduced that the main limiting factor for import is the poor ability of Kaps and cargos to find each other in the cytoplasm in a background of overwhelming nonspecific competition, rather than other more obvious candidates such as the nuclear pore complex and Ran. It is likely that most of every import round is taken up by Kaps and nuclear localization signals sampling other cytoplasmic proteins as they locate each other in the cytoplasm.},

The recently observed bimodal cargo distribution is predicted, as is the relative invariance of single cargo transit times out to large size (even as macroscopic transport rate decreases). Additional predictions concern the effects of the number of NLS tags, the RanGTP gradient, and phenylalanine-glycine nucleopore protein (FG-Nup) structure, flexibility, and cross-linking. Results are consistent with and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of some existing hypotheses (selective phase, virtual gate, and selective gate models).

We present a bioinformatics study conducted on more than a thousand FG Nups across 252 species. Our results reveal the regulatory role of polar residues and specific sequences of charged residues, named 'like charge regions' (LCRs), in the formation of the FG network at the center of the NPC.

  abstract = {A simple, inexpensive photolithographic method for surface patterning deformable, solvated substrates is demonstrated using photoactive poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-diacrylate hydrogels as model substrates. Photolithographic masks were prepared by printing the desired patterns onto transparencies using a laser jet printer. Precursor solutions containing monoacryloyl-PEG-peptide and photoinitiator were layered onto hydrogel surfaces. The acrylated moieties in the precursor solution were then conjugated in monolayers to specific hydrogel regions by exposure to UV light through the transparency mask. The effects of UV irradiation time and precursor solution concentration on the levels of immobilized peptide were characterized, demonstrating that bound peptide concentration can be controlled by tuning these parameters. Multiple peptides can be immobilized to a single hydrogel surface in distinct patterns by sequential application of this technique, opening up its potential use in co-cultures. In addition, 3D structures can be generated by incorporating PEG-diacrylate into the precursor solution. To evaluate the feasibility of using these patterned surfaces for guiding cell behavior, human dermal fibroblast adhesion on hydrogel surfaces patterned with acryloyl\textendash{}PEG\textendash{}RGDS was investigated. This patterning method may find use in tissue engineering, the elucidation of fundamental structure\textendash{}function relationships, and the formation of immobilized cell and protein arrays for biotechnology.},

We simultaneously test free diffusion in the channel, diffusion in optical traps coupled in the center of the channel, and diffusion in traps extending into the baths. We found that both classes of attractive optical potentials enhance the translocation rate through the channel with respect to free diffusion. Surprisingly, for the latter class of potentials we measure a 40-fold enhancement in the translocation rate with respect to free diffusion and find a sublinear power law dependence of the translocation rate on the average number of particles in the channel. Our results reveal the function of particle binding at the channel entrances for diffusive transport and open the way to a better understanding of membrane transport and design of synthetic membranes with enhanced diffusion rate.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1208440109},
  abstract = {Conformational changes at supramolecular interfaces are fundamentally coupled to binding activity, yet it remains a challenge to probe this relationship directly. Within the nuclear pore complex, this underlies how transport receptors known as karyopherins proceed through a tethered layer of intrinsically disordered nucleoporin domains containing Phe-Gly (FG)-rich repeats (FG domains) that otherwise hinder passive transport. Here, we use nonspecific proteins (i.e., BSA) as innate molecular probes to explore FG domain conformational changes by surface plasmon resonance. This mathematically diminishes the surface plasmon resonance refractive index constraint, thereby providing the means to acquire and correlate height changes in a surface-tethered FG domain layer to Kap binding affinities in situ with respect to their relative spatial arrangements. Stepwise measurements show that FG domain collapse is caused by karyopherin {$\beta$}1 (Kap{$\beta$}1) binding at low concentrations, but this gradually transitions into a reextension at higher Kap{$\beta$}1 concentrations. This ability to self-heal is intimately coupled to Kap{$\beta$}1-FG binding avidity that promotes the maximal incorporation of Kap{$\beta$}1 into the FG domain layer. Further increasing Kap{$\beta$}1 to physiological concentrations leads to a ``pileup'' of Kap{$\beta$}1 molecules that bind weakly to unoccupied FG repeats at the top of the layer. Therefore, binding avidity does not hinder fast transport per se. Revealing the biophysical basis underlying the form\textendash{}function relationship of Kap{$\beta$}1-FG domain behavior results in a convergent picture in which transport and mechanistic aspects of nuclear pore complex functionality are reconciled.},

  abstract = {We apply fluorescent correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to investigate solutiondynamics of a synthetic polyelectrolyte, i.e., a weak polycarboxylic acid in aqueous solutions. The technique brings single molecule sensitivity and molecular specificity to dynamic measurements of polyelectrolytesolutions. Translational diffusion of Alexa-labeled poly(methacrylic acid), PMAA*, chains was studied in very dilute, 10 -4 mg/ml , solutions as a function of solution p H and ionic strength. The observed changes in diffusion coefficients were consistent with about twofold expansion of PMAA* coils when p H was changed from 5 to 8, and with chain contraction for alkaline metal ion concentrations from 0.01 to 0.1 M. The dependence of the hydrodynamic size of PMAA* chains on the counterion type followed the sequence: Li + \&gt; Na + {$\approx$} Cs + \&gt; K + . The dependence of translational diffusion on polyacid concentration was weak at the low concentration limit, but chain motions were significantly slower at higher polymer concentrations when PMAA chains overlapped. Finally, measurements of dynamics of PMAA* chains in ``salt-free'' solutions showed that self-diffusion of PMAA* chains significantly slowed down when PMAA concentration was increased, probably reflecting the sensitivity of PMAA* translational motions to the onset of interchain domain formation. These results illustrate the utility of the FCS technique for studying hydrodynamic sizes of polyelectrolyte coils in response to variation in solution p H or concentration of salt and polyelectrolytes. They also suggest that FCS will be a promising technique for selective observation of the dynamics of polyelectrolyte components in complex polymer mixtures.},

  title = {[20] {{Kinetic}} Analysis of Amyloid Fibril Formation},
  volume = {309},
  abstract = {A nucleation-dependent polymerization model has been proposed to explain the mechanisms of amyloid fibril formation in vitro. This model consists of two phases\textemdash{}the nucleation and extension phases. Nucleus formation requires a series of association steps of monomers that are thermodynamically unfavorable, representing the rate-limiting step in amyloid fibril formation. Once the nucleus (n-mer) has been formed, the further addition of monomers becomes thermodynamically favorable, resulting in a rapid extension of amyloid fibrils. This chapter developes a first-order kinetic model of amyloid fibril extension in vitro and confirmed that the extension of amyloid fibrils proceeds via the consecutive association of monomeric precursor proteins onto the ends of existing fibrils. A characteristic sigmoidal time-course curve of amyloid fibril formation from monomeric precursor proteins at a physiological pH is widely believed to represent the essence of a nucleation-dependent polymerization model\textemdash{}that is, an initial lag phase represents the thermodynamically unfavorable nucleus formation. However, no convincing kinetic models to explain the sigmoidality of the curve have been reported. This chapter describes the paradigm to analyze the kinetic aspect of amyloid fibril formation in vitro. During the investigation of murine senile amyloidosis observed in the senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM), it develops a novel fluorometric method to determine amyloid fibrils in vitro based on the unique characteristics of thioflavin T (ThT). In recent years, this method has been applied to the analysis of several human amyloidoses, including gelsolin-derived amyloidosis, dialysis-related amyloidosis, and Alzheimer's {$\beta$}-amyloidosis. With this fluorometric method, this chapter successfully measures the polymerization velocity of three types of amyloid fibrils\textemdash{}that is, murine senile amyloid fibrils (fAApoAII), Alzheimer's {$\beta$}-amyloid fibrils (fA{$\beta$}), and dialysis-related amyloid fibrils (fA{$\beta$}2-m), and performs kinetic analysis of amyloid fibril polymerization in vitro.},

  abstract = {Active transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm involves primarily three classes of macromolecules: substrates, adaptors, and receptors. Some transport substrates bind directly to an import or an export receptor while others require one or more adaptors to mediate formation of a receptor-substrate complex. Once assembled, these transport complexes are transferred in one direction across the nuclear envelope through aqueous channels that are part of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Dissociation of the transport complex must then take place, and both adaptors and receptors must be recycled through the NPC to allow another round of transport to occur. Directionality of either import or export therefore depends on association between a substrate and its receptor on one side of the nuclear envelope and dissociation on the other. The Ran GTPase is critical in generating this asymmetry. Regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport generally involves specific inhibition of the formation of a transport complex; however, more global forms of regulation also occur.},

  abstract = {Amyloid fibrils are a polymeric form of protein, involving a continuous {$\beta$}-sheet with the strands perpendicular to the long axis of the fibril. Although typically implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, non disease-associated protein can also be converted into amyloid fibrils. Traditionally, amyloid fibrils are identified via the use of specific dyes such as Congo red and thioflavin-T, although their specificity is ill understood. Recently, solutions of bovine insulin and bovine {$\beta$}-lactoglobulin have been found to form spherulites, micron-sized spherical structures containing radially arranged amyloid fibrils. When studied by confocal microscopy using polarised laser light and thioflavin-T, a consistent pattern of emission, rather than a uniform disc, was observed. This suggests the dye binds in a specific, regular fashion to amyloid fibrils. Confocal microscopy studies of thioflavin-T aligned in stretched poly-vinyl alcohol films showed that the dye dipole excitation axis lies parallel to the long molecular axis. Therefore, thioflavin-T binds to amyloid fibrils such that their long axes are parallel. We propose binding occurs in `channels' that run along the length of the {$\beta$}-sheet. Steric interactions between dye molecules and side chains indicate why thioflavin-T fluoresces more intensely when bound to amyloid fibrils and can explain why this interaction with amyloid fibrils is specific, but with varying efficiency.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, the application of thioflavin stains to the diagnosis of amyloid is presented. Although Congo red stain is considered to be the generally accepted standard for the diagnosis of amyloid, it requires expertise and the use of polarized light microscopy; moreover, the diagnostic ``apple green birefringence'' of the dye may be difficult to visualize and, therefore, show low sensitivity. Congo red is a direct dye with different affinities for fibrillar and nonfibrillar materials. Therefore, the protocol involves staining followed by washing, and this may lead to significant levels of background stain and lower reproducibility. In contrast, the fluorochrome dyes, thioflavin S and T, exhibit a dramatic increase in fluorescent brightness upon binding to amyloid. The binding of thioflavin dyes is linked to the presence of cross-{$\beta$} structure in the amyloid fibrils, and this stain is very sensitive. However, thioflavin stains are less specific for amyloid than is the Congo red stain. Therefore, it is preferable to confirm the results obtained with thioflavin by either electron microscopy or the Congo red stain itself. Nevertheless, given the ease of staining, the predictability of stain outcome, and the ease of interpretation, adding thioflavin to the staining repertoire may be a welcome solution to problems that could arise from the use of Congo red stain alone in the clinical diagnosis of amyloid.},

  abstract = {Cells of eukaryotic species\textemdash{}which include plants, animals, and fungi\textemdash{}have a nucleus that harbours the organism's genome. Two membrane layers surround the nucleus and separate its contents from the cytoplasm, where proteins are made. This separation is essential for a correct interpretation of the genetic information. Yet, various molecules, such as proteins, need to move into or out of the nucleus for the cell to work properly. This transit has to occur without an uncontrolled mixing of the contents of the nucleus and the cytoplasm happening. Structures called nuclear pore complexes span the double membrane and allow material to be exchanged between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Small molecules can freely pass through these complexes, while larger molecules can only be transported when bound as ``cargo'' to so-called nuclear transport receptors. Nuclear pore complexes are large assemblies of proteins called nucleoporins. FG nucleoporins are special in that they contain regions with a repeating pattern of two amino acids, phenylalanine (`F') and glycine (`G'). These regions are called FG domains. They bind to nuclear transport receptors and have been suspected to form a barrier that decides which molecules may pass through the nuclear pore complex. Exactly how this control is exerted has been a matter of debate. Versions of a particular FG nucleoporin called Nup98 are found in all branches of eukaryotic life, i.e. in animals, fungi, plants, amoebas, and even in the evolutionarily most distant protozoans. When Schmidt and G\"orlich dispersed small amounts of Nup98 FG domains in an aqueous solution, the domains rapidly attracted each other to form `FG particles', regardless of which species the proteins came from. These FG particles were so dense that they repelled `normal' macromolecules, yet they allowed nuclear transport receptors, along with their bound cargoes, to rapidly enter. Taken together, the work of Schmidt and G\"orlich suggests that such FG particles form the transport barrier in nuclear pore complexes. Based on these findings, Schmidt and G\"orlich refine a model where the FG domains form a mesh in the nuclear pore complexes that acts like a `smart sieve'. Smaller molecules can move through gaps in the meshwork, but larger molecules are hindered. Schmidt and G\"orlich suggest that nuclear transport receptors help large molecules to move through nuclear pore complexes by `melting' the FG meshwork locally, creating a path for the molecule to move through. The reconstitution of these smart barriers in the laboratory will now allow researchers to analyse the process of receptor-mediated nuclear pore passage in unprecedented (mechanistic) detail.},

  abstract = {In the search for the molecular mechanism of insulin fibrillation, the kinetics of insulin fibril formation were studied under different conditions using the fluorescent dye thioflavin T (ThT). The effect of insulin concentration, agitation, pH, ionic strength, anions, seeding, and addition of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS), urea, TMAO, sucrose, and ThT on the kinetics of fibrillation was investigated. The kinetics of the fibrillation process could be described by the lag time for formation of stable nuclei (nucleation) and the apparent rate constant for the growth of fibrils (elongation). The addition of seeds eliminated the lag phase. An increase in insulin concentration resulted in shorter lag times and faster growth of fibrils. Shorter lag times and faster growth of fibrils were seen at acidic pH versus neutral pH, whereas an increase in ionic strength resulted in shorter lag times and slower growth of fibrils. There was no clear correlation between the rate of fibril elongation and ionic strength. Agitation during fibril formation attenuated the effects of insulin concentration and ionic strength on both lag times and fibril growth. The addition of ANS increased the lag time and decreased the apparent growth rate for insulin fibril formation. The ANS-induced inhibition appears to reflect the formation of amorphous aggregates. The denaturant, urea, decreased the lag time, whereas the stabilizers, trimethylamine N-oxide dihydrate (TMAO) and sucrose, increased the lag times. The results indicated that both nucleation and fibril growth were controlled by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. A kinetic model, involving the association of monomeric partially folded intermediates, whose concentration is stimulated by the air-water interface, leading to formation of the critical nucleus and thence fibrils, is proposed.},

  abstract = {Polymer-nanoparticle composites are a promising new class of materials for creation of controllable nano-patterned surfaces and nanopores. We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations augmented with analytical theory to study the structural transitions of surface grafted polymer layers (brushes) induced by infiltration of nanoparticles that are attracted to the polymers in the layer. We systematically compare two different polymer brush geometries: one where the polymer chains are grafted to a planar surface and the other where the chains are grafted to the inside of a cylindrical nanochannel. We perform a comprehensive study of the effects of the material parameters such as the polymer chain length, chain grafting density, nanoparticle size, strength of attraction between nanoparticles and polymer monomers, and, in the case of the cylindrically grafted brush, the radius of the cylinder. We find a very general behavioral motif for all geometries and parameter values: the height of the polymer brush is non-monotonic in the nanoparticle concentration in solution. As the nanoparticle concentration increases, the brush height first decreases and after passing through a minimum value begins to increase, resulting in the swelling of the nanoparticle infused brush. These morphological features may be useful for devising tunable "smart" nano-devices whose effective dimensions can be reversibly and precisely adjusted by changing the nanoparticle concentration in solution. The results of approximate Self-Consistent Field Theory (SCFT) calculations, applicable in the regime of strong brush stretching, are compared to the simulation results. The SCFT calculations are found to be qualitatively, even semi-quantitatively, accurate when applied within their intended regime of validity, and provide a useful and efficient tool for modeling such materials.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary `decision' to store genetic information away from the place of protein synthesis, in a separate compartment, has forced eukaryotic cells to establish a system to transport mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. To ensure export to be fast and efficient, cells have evolved a complex molecular interplay that is tightly regulated. Over the last few decades, many of the individual players in this process have been described, starting with the composition of the nuclear pore complex to proteins that modulate co-transcriptional events required to prepare an mRNP for export to the cytoplasm. How the interplay between all the factors and processes results in the efficient and selective export of mRNAs from the nucleus and how the export process itself is executed within cells, however, is still not fully understood. Recent advances in using proteomic and single molecule microscopy approaches have provided important insights into the process and its kinetics. This review summarizes these recent advances and how they led to the current view on how cells orchestrate the export of mRNAs.

In aqueous solutions, thioflavin T was found to exist as micelles at concentrations commonly used to monitor fibrils by fluorescence assay ({$\sim$}10\textendash{}20 {$\mu$}M). Specific conductivity changes were measured at varying concentration of thioflavin T and the critical micellar concentration was calculated to be 4.0 {$\pm$} 0.5 {$\mu$}M. Interestingly, changes in the fluorescence excitation and emission of thioflavin T were also dependent on the micelle formation. The thioflavin T micelles of 3 nm diameter were directly visualized using atomic force microscopy, and bound thioflavin T micelles were observed along the fibril length for representative fibrils. Increasing concentration of thioflavin T above the critical micellar concentration shows increased numbers of micelles bound along the length of the amyloid fibrils. Thioflavin T micelles were disrupted at low pH as observed by atomic force microscopy and fluorescence enhancement upon binding of thioflavin T to amyloid fibrils also reduced by several-fold upon decreasing the pH to below 3. This suggests that positive charge on the thioflavin T molecule has a role in its micelle formation that then bind the amyloid fibrils. Our data suggests that the micelles of thioflavin T bind amyloid fibrils leading to enhancement of fluorescence emission.},

The autocorrelation function for two different particles in solution were computed, statistical noise was added, and the resulting curve was fitted with a least squares fit. These simulations show that the ability to distinguish between two different molecular species in solution depends strongly on the number of photons detected from each particle, their difference in size, and the concentration of each component in solution. To distinguish two components, their diffusion times must differ by at least a factor of 1.6 for comparable quantum yields and a high fluorescence signal. Experiments were conducted with Rhodamine 6G and Rhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumin. The experimental results support the simulations. In addition, they show that even with a high fluorescence signal but significantly different quantum yields, the diffusion times must differ by a factor much bigger than 1.6 to distinguish the two components. Depending on the quantum yields and the difference in size, there exists a concentration threshold for the less abundant component below which it is not possible to determine with statistical means alone that two particles are in solution.},

We constructed a point mutant of p10, D23A, that exhibited unexpected behavior both in digitonin-permeabilized and microinjected mammalian cells. D23A p10 was markedly more efficient than wild-type (wt) p10 at supporting Ran import, but simultaneously acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of classical nuclear localization sequence (cNLS)-mediated nuclear import supported by karyopherins (Kaps) {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}1. Binding studies indicated that these two nuclear transport carriers of different classes, p10 and Kap-{$\beta$}1, compete for identical and/or overlapping binding sites at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and that D23A p10 has an increased affinity relative to wt p10 and Kap-{$\beta$}1 for these shared binding sites. Because of this increased affinity, D23A p10 is able to import its own cargo (RanGDP) more efficiently than wt p10, but Kap-{$\beta$}1 can no longer compete efficiently for shared NPC docking sites, thus the import of cNLS cargo is inhibited. The competition of different nuclear carriers for shared NPC docking sites observed here predicts a dynamic equilibrium between multiple nuclear transport pathways inside the cell that could be easily shifted by a transient modification of one of the carriers.},

The relative stability of these two phases depends on the interpolymer interactions.

We report on the Brownian motion of micrometer-sized beads of glass held in air by an optical tweezer, over a wide range of pressures, and we measured the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle. Our results provide direct verification of the energy equipartition theorem for a Brownian particle. For short times, the ballistic regime of Brownian motion was observed, in contrast to the usual diffusive regime. We discuss the applications of these methods toward cooling the center-of-mass motion of a bead in vacuum to the quantum ground motional state.

  abstract = {The cells of animals, plants and other eukaryotic organisms contain a compartment called the nucleus that contains most of the cell's genetic material. Proteins and other molecules \textendash{} collectively known as cargos \textendash{} can enter and exit the nucleus via tiny channels in the membrane that surrounds and protects it. Receptor proteins \textendash{} called nuclear transport receptors \textendash{} bind to potential cargos and shuttle them through the channels. This selective transport process relies on the nuclear transport receptors being attracted to flexible, spaghetti-like proteins that are anchored to the walls on the inside of each channel. However, because of their flexible and disordered nature, these so-called FG domains are difficult to study, and the details of the transport process are poorly understood. Zahn, Osmanovi\'c et al. decided to study how the FG domains behave and what happens when they interact with nuclear transport receptors by using ultrathin films made of just the FG domains. This is a good model system because the films are easier to study than the whole channels, but are likely to retain the essential properties of the real barrier formed in the nuclear envelope. Zahn, Osmanovi\'c et al. compared the binding of two nuclear transport receptors of different sizes, taken from humans and yeast, to FG domain films made from one of three different FG domains. The experiments showed that the different nuclear transport receptors bind to the different FG domains in very similar ways. Zahn, Osmanovi\'c et al. then used a computational model that essentially represented the FG domains as sticky spaghetti and the nuclear transport receptors as perfectly round meatballs. This sticky-spaghetti-with-meatballs model reproduced the experimental data, implying that the exact chemical make-up and structure of the molecules may not be critical for controlling the transport of cargo across the nuclear envelope. Future studies will test whether the generic physical features of nuclear transport receptors and FG domains can indeed explain how the cargo molecules pass through the nuclear envelope.},

Nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) carry cargos through NPCs by transiently binding to phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats on intrinsically disordered polypeptides decorating the NPCs. Major impediments to understand the transport mechanism are the thousands of FG binding sites on each NPC, whose spatial distribution is unknown, and multiple binding sites per NTR, which leads to multivalent interactions. Using single molecule fluorescence microscopy, we show that multiple NTR molecules are required for efficient transport of a large cargo, while a single NTR promotes binding to the NPC but not transport. Particle trajectories and theoretical modelling reveal a crucial role for multivalent NTR interactions with the FG network and indicate a non-uniform FG repeat distribution. A quantitative model is developed wherein the cytoplasmic side of the pore is characterized by a low effective concentration of free FG repeats and a weak FG-NTR affinity, and the centrally located dense permeability barrier is overcome by multivalent interactions, which provide the affinity necessary to permeate the barrier.},

This protocol describes a method for chemical cross-linking of proteins using formaldehyde. With the exception of zero-length cross-linkers, formaldehyde has the shortest cross-linking span (\textasciitilde{}2-3 \AA{}) of any cross-linking reagent, thus making it an ideal tool for detecting specific protein-protein interactions with great confidence. Despite its simple chemical structure (CH2O), formaldehyde's single carbonyl group functions essentially as a homobifunctional reagent and is capable of conjugating targets through two different chemical pathways. In Mannich-type reactions, which typically require elevated temperatures (37\textdegree{}C or above) for a period of 2-24 hours for acceptable yields, formaldehyde condenses with amines (1\textdegree, 2\textdegree, or salts of ammonia) and compounds with active hydrogens to form stable cross-links. Formaldehyde also reacts with amines to form highly reactive immonium cations that are reactive toward protein-containing nucleophiles, including sulfhydryls, amines, phenols, and imidazoles. The latter reaction is more rapid than the former and is generally the more predominant in typical protein cross-linking reactions at ambient temperatures.},

We probed the passive barrier of NPCs and observed sieve-like properties with a dominating mesh or channel radius of 2.6 nm, which is narrower than proposed earlier. A small fraction of diffusion channels has a wider opening, explaining the very slow passage of larger molecules. The observed dominant passive diameter approximates the distance of adjacent hydrophobic clusters of FG repeats, supporting the model that the barrier is made of FG repeat domains cross-linked with a spacing of an FG repeat unit length. Wheat germ agglutinin and the dominant-negative importin beta(45-462) fragment were previously regarded as selective inhibitors of facilitated NPC passage. We now observed that they do not distinguish between the passive and the facilitated mode. Instead, their inhibitory effect correlates with the size of the NPC-passing molecule. They have little effect on small species, inhibit the passage of green fluorescent protein-sized objects {$>$}10-fold and virtually block the translocation of larger ones. This suggests that passive and facilitated NPC passage proceed through one and the same permeability barrier.},

In a typical immunoaffinity experiment, protein complexes are captured from a cell lysate by an immobilized antibody that recognizes an epitope on one of the known components of the complex. After extensive washing to remove unspecifically bound proteins, the complexes are eluted and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Transient complexes, which are characterized by high dissociation constants, are typically lost by this approach. In the present study, we describe a novel method for identifying transient protein-protein interactions using in vivo cross-linking and MS-based protein identification. Live cells are treated with formaldehyde, which rapidly permeates the cell membrane and generates protein-protein cross-links. Proteins cross-linked to a Myc-tagged protein of interest are copurified by immunoaffinity chromatography and subjected to a procedure which dissociates the cross-linked complexes. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins are identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Application of this method enabled the identification of numerous proteins that copurified with a constitutively active form of M-Ras (M-RasQ71L). Among these, we identified the RasGAP-related protein IQGAP1 to be a novel interaction partner of M-RasQ71L. This method is applicable to many proteins and will aid in the study of protein-protein interactions.},

inhibited by NTRs, providing a rationale on how the cell might control amyloid formation of
FG Nups. The superb spatial resolving power of EM also reveals that hydrogels are enlaced

The NPC provides two types of nucleocytoplasmic transport: passive diffusion of small molecules and active chaperon-mediated translocation of large molecules. It has been shown that the interaction between intrinsically disordered proteins that line the central channel of the NPC and the transporting cargoes is the determining factor, but the exact mechanism of transport is yet unknown. Here, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the energy barrier that has to be overcome for molecules to pass through the NPC. We focus on two aspects of transport. First, the passive transport of model cargo molecules with different sizes is studied and the size selectivity feature of the NPC is investigated. Our results show that the transport probability of cargoes is significantly reduced when they are larger than similar to 5 nm in diameter. Secondly, we show that incorporating hydrophobic binding spots on the surface of the cargo effectively decreases the energy barrier of the pore. Finally, a simple transport model is proposed which characterizes the energy barrier of the NPC as a function of diameter and hydrophobicity of the transporting particles.},

Among them, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has been extremely successful in the last decade and has become an indispensable technique for addressing many of the fundamental questions regarding the activities of IDPs. After introducing some experimental issues specific to IDPs and in relation to the latest technical developments, this article presents the interest of the theory of polymer physics to evaluate the flexibility of fully disordered proteins. The different strategies to obtain 3-dimensional models of IDPs, free in solution and associated in a complex, are then reviewed. Indeed, recent computational advances have made it possible to readily extract maximum information from the scattering curve with a special emphasis on highly flexible systems, such as multidomain proteins and IDPs. Furthermore, integrated computational approaches now enable the generation of ensembles of conformers to translate the unique flexible characteristics of IDPs by taking into consideration the constraints of more and more various complementary experiment. In particular, a combination of SAXS with high-resolution techniques, such as x-ray crystallography and NMR, allows us to provide reliable models and to gain unique structural insights about the protein over multiple structural scales. The latest neutron scattering experiments also promise new advances in the study of the conformational changes of macromolecules involving more complex systems.},

Based on the principle of a flow-focusing device to emulsify the coflow of aqueous solutions in an organic phase, we were able to produce the following innovative polysaccharide hydrogel microparticles:-
Janus hydrogel microparticles made of pectin\textendash{}pectin (homo Janus) and pectin\textendash{}alginate (hetero Janus) were produced. The efficiency of separation of the two hemispheres was investigated by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) of previously labelled biopolymers. The Janus structure was confirmed by subjecting each microparticle hemisphere to specific enzymatic degradation. As a proof of concept, free BSA or BSA grafted with dextran, were encapsulated in each hemisphere of the hetero Janus hydrogel microparticles. While BSA, free or grafted with dextran, was always confined in the alginate hemisphere, a fraction of BSA diffused from the pectin to the alginate hemisphere. Methoxy groups along the pectin chain will be responsible of the decrease of the number of attractive electrostatic interactions occurring between amino groups of BSA and carboxylic groups of pectin.
-
Pectin hydrogel microparticles of complex shapes were successfully produced by combining on-chip the phenomenon of gelation and water diffusion induced self-assembly, using dimethyl carbonate as continuous phase, or by deformation of the pre-gelled droplets off-chip at a fluid\textendash{}fluid interface. Sphere, oblate ellipsoid, torus or mushroom-type morphologies were thus obtained. Moreover, it was established that after crossing the interface during their collect, mushroom-type microparticles did not migrate in the calcium or DMC phase but stayed at the liquid\textendash{}liquid interface.

These new and original hydrogel microparticles will open up opportunities for studying relationships between combined enzymatic hydrolysis and active release for Janus particles and relationships between shape and swelling behaviour for anisotropic pectin microparticles.},

  abstract = {The molecular structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the translocation of model particles have been studied with a molecular theory that accounts for the geometry of the pore and the sequence and anchoring position of the unfolded domains of the nucleoporin proteins (the FG-Nups), which control selective transport through the pore. The theory explicitly models the electrostatic, hydrophobic, steric, conformational, and acid-base properties of the FG-Nups. The electrostatic potential within the pore, which arises from the specific charge distribution of the FG-Nups, is predicted to be negative close to pore walls and positive along the pore axis. The positive electrostatic potential facilitates the translocation of negatively charged particles, and the free energy barrier for translocation decreases for increasing particle hydrophobicity. These results agree with the experimental observation that transport receptors that form complexes with hydrophilic/neutral or positively charged proteins to transport them through the NPC are both hydrophobic and strongly negatively charged. The molecular theory shows that the effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions on the translocating potential are cooperative and nonequivalent due to the interaction-dependent reorganization of the FG-Nups in the presence of the translocating particle. The combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions can give rise to complex translocation potentials displaying a combination of wells and barriers, in contrast to the simple barrier potential observed for a hydrophilic/neutral translocating particle. This work demonstrates the importance of explicitly considering the amino acid sequence and hydrophobic, electrostatic, and steric interactions in understanding the translocation through the NPC.},

  abstract = {Many biological and artificial transport channels function without direct input of metabolic energy during a transport event and without structural rearrangements involving transitions from a closed to an open state. Nevertheless, such channels are able to maintain efficient and selective transport. It has been proposed that attractive interactions between the transported molecules and the channel can increase the transport efficiency and that the selectivity of such channels can be based on the strength of the interaction of the specifically transported molecules with the channel. Herein, we study the transport through narrow channels in a framework of a general kinetic theory, which naturally incorporates multiparticle occupancy of the channel and non-single-file transport. We study how the transport efficiency and the probability of translocation through the channel are affected by interparticle interactions in the confined space inside the channel, and establish conditions for selective transport. We compare the predictions of the model with the available experimental data and find good semiquantitative agreement. Finally, we discuss applications of the theory to the design of artificial nanomolecular sieves.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can provide a wealth of information about biological and chemical systems on a broad range of time scales ({$<$}1 micros to {$>$}1 s). Numerical modeling of the FCS observation volume combined with measurements has revealed, however, that the standard assumption of a three-dimensional Gaussian FCS observation volume is not a valid approximation under many common measurement conditions. As a result, the FCS autocorrelation will contain significant, systematic artifacts that are most severe with confocal optics when using a large detector aperture and aperture-limited illumination. These optical artifacts manifest themselves in the fluorescence correlation as an apparent additional exponential component or diffusing species with significant ({$>$}30\%) amplitude that can imply extraneous kinetics, shift the measured diffusion time by as much as approximately 80\%, and cause the axial ratio to diverge. Artifacts can be minimized or virtually eliminated by using a small confocal detector aperture, underfilled objective back-aperture, or two-photon excitation. However, using a detector aperture that is smaller or larger than the optimal value (approximately 4.5 optical units) greatly reduces both the count rate per molecule and the signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, there is a tradeoff between optimizing signal-to-noise and reducing experimental artifacts in one-photon FCS.},

  abstract = {The aggregation process and the fibril state of an amyloidogenic peptide suggest monomer addition to be the prevailing mechanism of elongation and a model of the peptide packing in the fibrils has been obtained., Structural analysis of protein fibrillation is inherently challenging. Given the crucial role of fibrils in amyloid diseases, method advancement is urgently needed. A hybrid modelling approach is presented enabling detailed analysis of a highly ordered and hierarchically organized fibril of the GNNQQNY peptide fragment of a yeast prion protein. Data from small-angle X-ray solution scattering, fibre diffraction and electron microscopy are combined with existing high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures to investigate the fibrillation process and the hierarchical fibril structure of the peptide fragment. The elongation of these fibrils proceeds without the accumulation of any detectable amount of intermediate oligomeric species, as is otherwise reported for, for example, glucagon, insulin and {$\alpha$}-synuclein. Ribbons constituted of linearly arranged protofilaments are formed. An additional hierarchical layer is generated via the pairing of ribbons during fibril maturation. Based on the complementary data, a quasi-atomic resolution model of the protofilament peptide arrangement is suggested. The peptide structure appears in a {$\beta$}-sheet arrangement reminiscent of the {$\beta$}-zipper structures evident from high-resolution crystal structures, with specific differences in the relative peptide orientation. The complexity of protein fibrillation and structure emphasizes the need to use multiple complementary methods.},

A small spot on the fluorescent surface is photobleached by a brief exposure to an intense focused laser beam, and the subsequent recovery of the fluorescence is monitored by the same, but attenuated, laser beam. Recovery occurs by replenishment of intact fluorophore in the bleached spot by lateral transport from the surrounding surface. We present the theoretical basis and some practical guidelines for simple, rigorous analysis of FPR experiments. Information obtainable from FPR experiments includes: (a) identification of transport process type, i.e. the admixture of random diffusion and uniform directed flow; (b) determination of the absolute mobility coefficient, i.e. the diffusion constant and/or flow velocity; and (c) the fraction of total fluorophore which is mobile. To illustrate the experimental method and to verify the theory for diffusion, we describe some model experiments on aqueous solutions of rhodamine 6G.},

Consequently, many aspects of its architecture, general function, and role in the life cycle of a cell are well understood. Over the last decade, fluorescence microscopy methods have enabled the real-time visualization of single molecules interacting with and transiting through the NPC, allowing novel questions to be examined with nanometer precision. While initial single-molecule studies focused primarily on import pathways using permeabilized cells, it has recently proven feasible to investigate the export of mRNAs in living cells. Single-molecule assays can address questions that are difficult or impossible to answer by other means, yet the complexity of nucleocytoplasmic transport requires that interpretation be based on a firm genetic, biochemical, and structural foundation. Moreover, conceptually simple single-molecule experiments remain technically challenging, particularly with regard to signal intensity, signal-to-noise ratio, and the analysis of noise, stochasticity, and precision. We discuss nuclear transport issues recently addressed by single-molecule microscopy, evaluate the limits of existing assays and data, and identify open questions for future studies. We expect that single-molecule fluorescence approaches will continue to be applied to outstanding nucleocytoplasmic transport questions, and that the approaches developed for NPC studies are extendable to additional complex systems and pathways within cells.},

The interaction between NTF2 and Ran is essential for the import of Ran into the nucleus. Here we use mutational analysis to dissect the in vivo role of the interaction between NTF2 and nucleoporins. We identify a series of surface residues that form a hydrophobic patch on NTF2, which when mutated disrupt the NTF2-nucleoporin interaction. Analysis of these mutants in vivo demonstrates that the strength of this interaction can be significantly reduced without affecting cell viability. However, cells cease to be viable if the interaction between NTF2 and nucleoporins is abolished completely, indicating that this interaction is essential for the function of NTF2 in vivo. In addition, we have isolated a dominant negative mutant of NTF2, N77Y, which has increased affinity for nucleoporins. Overexpression of the N77Y protein blocks nuclear protein import and concentrates Ran at the nuclear rim. These data support a mechanism in which NTF2 interacts transiently with FxFG nucleoporins to translocate through the pore and import RanGDP into the nucleus.},

The protein stretches the plug and creates a local deformation, which together with the protein, we refer to as the bubble. We start with the free energy for creation of the bubble and consider its motion within the plug. The relevant coordinate is the center of the bubble which executes random walk.

  abstract = {Regulation of nuclear transport is an essential component of apoptosis. As chemotherapy induced cell death progresses, nuclear transport and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) are slowly disrupted and dismantled. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and the camptothecin derivatives irinotecan and topotecan, are linked to altered nuclear transport of specific proteins; however, their general effects on the NPC and transport during apoptosis have not been characterized. We demonstrate that 5-FU, but not topotecan, increases NPC permeability, and disrupts Ran-mediated nuclear transport before the disruption of the NPC. This increased permeability is dependent on increased cellular calcium, as the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM, abolishes the effect. Furthermore, increased calcium alone was sufficient to disrupt the Ran gradient. Combination treatments of 5-FU with topotecan or irinotecan, similarly disrupted nuclear transport before disassembly of the NPC. In both single and combination treatments nuclear transport was disrupted before caspase 9 activation, indicating that 5-FU induces an early caspase-independent increase in NPC permeability and alteration of nuclear transport. Because Crm1-mediated nuclear export of tumor suppressors is linked to drug resistance we also examined the effect of 5-FU on the nuclear export of a specific target, topoisomerase. 5-FU treatment led to accumulation of topoisomerase in the nucleus and recovered the loss nuclear topoisomerase induced by irinotecan or topotecan, a known cause of drug resistance. Furthermore, 5-FU retains its ability to cause nuclear accumulation of p53 in the presence of irinotecan or topotecan. Our results reveal a new mechanism of action for these therapeutics during apoptosis, opening the door to other potential combination chemotherapies that employ 5-FU as a calcium mediated inhibitor of Crm1-induced nuclear export of tumor suppressors.},

Small molecules can passively diffuse through the NPC, whereas larger cargos require transport receptors to translocate(1). How the NPC facilitates the translocation of transport receptor/cargo complexes remains unclear. To investigate this process, we tracked single protein-functionalized quantum dot cargos as they moved through human NPCs. Here we show that import proceeds by successive substeps comprising cargo capture, filtering and translocation, and release into the nucleus. Most quantum dots are rejected at one of these steps and return to the cytoplasm, including very large cargos that abort at a size-selective barrier. Cargo movement in the central channel is subdiffusive and cargos that can bind more transport receptors diffuse more freely. Without Ran GTPase, a critical regulator of transport directionality(1), cargos still explore the entire NPC, but have a markedly reduced probability of exit into the nucleus, suggesting that NPC entry and exit steps are not equivalent and that the pore is functionally asymmetric to importing cargos. The overall selectivity of the NPC seems to arise from the cumulative action of multiple reversible substeps and a final irreversible exit step.},

Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding of FG-repeat peptides to the surface of NTF2, the Ran importer. The simulations, covering over 254~ns, agree with previous X-ray, mutational, NMR, and computational data in identifying four binding spots. They also serve to provide an all-atom view of binding at each spot, whereas FG-repeat binding has been only directly observed at a single spot. Furthermore, the simulations identify two novel binding spots in addition to the four others. All six binding spots broadly form a stripe across the surface of NTF2. The resulting regularity and proximity of binding spots on the surface may be necessary for identification of the transport receptor by the FG-repeats in the nuclear pore complex and for the successful transit of NTF2 through the pore.},

the quality resembled that of hypertrophic cartilage with positive staining for

A one-bead-per-amino-acid model is presented that accounts for the hydrophobic/hydrophilic and electrostatic interactions between different amino acids, polarity of the solvent, and screening of free ions. The results indicate that the interaction of the FG-nups forms a high-density, doughnut-like distribution inside the NPC, which is rich in FG-repeats. We show that the obtained distribution is encoded in the amino-acid sequence of the FG-nups and is driven by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. To explore the relation between structure and function, we have systematically removed different combinations of FG-nups from the pore to simulate inviable and viable NPCs that were previously studied experimentally. The obtained density distributions show that the maximum density of the FG-nups inside the pore does not exceed 185~mg/mL in the inviable NPCs, whereas for the wild-type and viable NPCs, this value increases to 300~mg/mL. Interestingly, this maximum density is not correlated to the total mass of the FG-nups, but depends sensitively on the specific combination of essential Nups located in the central plane of the NPC.},

In this work, an algorithm is presented that considers the essential features of FCS. It allows prediction of the performance of FCS measurements in various cases, which is important for finding optimal experimental conditions. The program calculates the SD of the experimental autocorrelation function online. This procedure leads to improved parameter estimation, compared to currently used theoretical approximations for the SD. Three methods for the calculation of the SD are presented and compared to earlier analytical solutions (D. E. Koppel. 1974. Phys. Rev. A. 10:1938-1945.), calculation directly from fluorescence intensity values, by averaging several FCS measurements, or by dividing one measurement into a set of shorter data packages. Although the averaging over several measurements yields accurate estimates for the SD, the other two methods are considerably less time consuming, can be run online, and yield comparable results.},

Confocal FRAP is a potentially important tool for the quantitative analysis of intracellular binding-diffusion kinetics, but how to dependably extract accurate kinetic constants from such analyses is still an open question. To this end, in this study, we developed what we believe is a new analytical model for confocal FRAP-based measurements of intracellular binding-diffusion processes, based on a closed-form equation of the FRAP formula for a spot photobleach geometry. This approach incorporates a binding diffusion model that allows for diffusion of both the unbound and bound species, and also compensates for binding diffusion that occurs during photobleaching, a critical consideration in confocal FRAP analysis. In addition, to address the problem of parametric multiplicity, we propose a scheme to reduce the number of fitting parameters in the effective diffusion subregime when D's for the bound and unbound species are known. We validate this method by measuring kinetic rate constants for the CAAX-mediated binding of Ras to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, obtaining binding constants of kon {$\sim$} 255/s and koff {$\sim$} 31/s.},

Such channels have be selective, i.e. to pass only certain molecular species in a given direction, while efficiently blocking the passage of all others. Transport properties of some channels (e.g. ion channels), have been extensively studied. However, the mechanisms of channels that conduct larger molecules, such as the nuclear pore complex, which gates all transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm, are less understood. In particular, it is still not clear how such channels can efficiently transport their specific molecules even in the presence of a vast excess of non-specific molecules that potentially could clog the channel. Understanding how such channels work is also important for technological applications, such as design of artificial nano-filters. In this paper, we propose a mechanism of selectivity of such channels in the presence of vast amounts of background molecular noise. The predictions of the theory account for the behavior of the nuclear pore complex and of artificial nanochannels that mimic its function. The theory provides the basis for future work aimed at understanding the selectivity of transport through various biological and artificial channels.},

  abstract = {Methods for chemical modifications of proteins have been crucial for the advancement of proteomics. In particular, site-specific covalent labeling of proteins with fluorophores and other moieties has permitted the development of a multitude of assays for proteome analysis. A common approach for such a modification is solvent-accessible cysteine labeling using thiol-reactive dyes. Cysteine is very attractive for site-specific conjugation due to its relative rarity throughout the proteome and the ease of its introduction into a specific site along the protein's amino acid chain. This is achieved by site-directed mutagenesis, most often without perturbing the protein's function. Bottlenecks in this reaction, however, include the maintenance of reactive thiol groups without oxidation before the reaction, and the effective removal of unreacted molecules prior to fluorescence studies. Here, we describe an efficient, specific, and rapid procedure for cysteine labeling starting from well-reduced proteins in the solid state. The efficacy and specificity of the improved procedure are estimated using a variety of single-cysteine proteins and thiol-reactive dyes. Based on UV/vis absorbance spectra, coupling efficiencies are typically in the range 70\textendash{}90\%, and specificities are better than \textasciitilde{}95\%. The labeled proteins are evaluated using fluorescence assays, proving that the covalent modification does not alter their function. In addition to maleimide-based conjugation, this improved procedure may be used for other thiol-reactive conjugations such as haloacetyl, alkyl halide, and disulfide interchange derivatives. This facile and rapid procedure is well suited for high throughput proteome analysis.},

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the sole passage through the nuclear envelope, connecting the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm. These gigantic molecular machines, over 100 MDa in molecular weight, allow free diffusion of small molecules and ions while mediating selective energy-dependent nucleocytoplasmic transport of large macromolecules. Here, we applied cryo-electron tomography to human fibroblast cells, reconstructing their nuclear envelopes without applying any purification steps. From these reconstructions, we extracted subtomograms containing individual NPCs and utilized in silico subtomogram averaging procedures to determine the structure of the mammalian pore complex at a resolution of {$\sim$}6.6~nm. Beyond revealing the canonical features of the human NPC, our analysis identified inner lateral channels and fusing bridge-like structures, suggesting alternative routes of peripheral nuclear passage. Finally, we concluded from our structural analysis that the human NPC is structurally distinct from that of lower eukaryotes in terms of dimension and organization but resembles its amphibian (frog) counterpart.},

The assembled similar to 40-112 MDa NPC can be visualized by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET), while Nup subcomplexes are studied crystallographically. Docking the crystal structures into the cryo-ET maps is difficult because of limited resolution. Further, intersubcomplex contacts are not well characterized. Here, we systematically investigated direct interactions between Nups. In a comprehensive, structure-based, yeast two-hybrid interaction matrix screen, we mapped protein-protein interactions in yeast and human. Benchmarking against crystallographic and coaffinity purification data from the literature demonstrated the high coverage and accuracy of the data set. Novel intersubcomplex interactions were validated biophysically in microscale thermophoresis experiments and in intact cells through protein fragment complementation. These intersubcomplex interaction data provide direct experimental evidence toward possible structural arrangements of architectural elements within the assembled NPC, or they may point to assembly intermediates.

  abstract = {Metazoan NXF1/p15 heterodimers promote export of bulk mRNA through nuclear pore complexes (NPC). NXF1 interacts with the NPC via two distinct structural domains, the UBA-like domain and the NTF2-like scaffold, which results from the heterodimerization of the NTF2-like domain of NXF1 with p15. Both domains feature a single nucleoporin-binding site, and they act synergistically to promote NPC translocation. Whether the NTF2-like scaffold (and thereby p15) contributes only to NXF1/NPC association or is also required for other functions, e.g., to impart directionality to the export process by regulating NXF1/NPC or NXF1/cargo interactions, remains unresolved. Here we show that a minimum of two nucleoporin-binding sites is required for NXF1-mediated export of cellular mRNA. These binding sites can be provided by an NTF2-like scaffold followed by a UBA-like domain (as in the wild-type protein) or by two NTF2-like scaffolds or two UBA-like domains in tandem. In the latter case, the export activity of NXF1 is independent of p15. Thus, as for the UBA-like domain, the function of the NTF2-like scaffold is confined to nucleoporin binding. More importantly, two copies of either of these domains are sufficient to promote directional transport of mRNA cargoes across the NPC.},

  abstract = {We have used a range of complementary biochemical and biophysical methods to investigate the interactions between nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2), the Ras family GTPase Ran, andXFXFG nucleoporin repeats that are crucial for nuclear trafficking. Microcalorimetry, microtiter plate binding, and fluorescence quenching in solution are all consistent with the binding constant for the NTF2-RanGDP interaction being in the 100 nm range, whereas the interaction between NTF2 andXFXFG repeat-containing nucleoporins such as Nsp1p is in the 1 {$\mu$}m range. Although the accumulation of NTF2 at the nuclear envelope is enhanced by RanGDP, we show that Ran binding does not alter the affinity of NTF2 for nucleoporins nor does the binding of nucleoporins alter the affinity of NTF2 for RanGDP. These results indicate that, instead, Ran increases the binding of NTF2 to nucleoporins by another mechanism, most probably by Ran itself binding to nucleoporins and NTF2 binding to this nuclear pore-associated Ran.},

  abstract = {For decades, formaldehyde has been routinely used to cross-link proteins in cells, tissue, and in some instances, even entire organisms. Due to its small size, formaldehyde can readily permeate cell walls and membranes, resulting in efficient cross-linking, i.e. the formation of covalent bonds between proteins, DNA, and other reactive molecules. Indeed, formaldehyde cross-linking is an instrumental component of many mainstream analytical/cell biology techniques including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of protein-DNA complexes found in nuclei; immunohistological analysis of protein expression and localization within cells, tissues, and organs; and mass spectrometry (MS)-compatible silver-staining methodologies used to visualize low abundance proteins in polyacrylamide gels. However, despite its exquisite suitability for use in the analysis of protein environments within cells, formaldehyde has yet to be commonly employed in the directed analysis of protein\textendash{}protein interactions and cellular networks. The general purpose of this article is to discuss recent advancements in the use of formaldehyde cross-linking in combination with MS-based methodologies. Key advantages and limitations to the use of formaldehyde over other cross-linkers and technologies currently used to study protein\textendash{}protein interactions are highlighted, and formaldehyde-based experimental approaches that are proving very promising in their ability to accurately and efficiently identify novel protein\textendash{}protein and multiprotein interaction complexes are presented.

Different types of binding sites are likely to be present in amyloid fibrils with differences in binding modes. ThT may bind in channels running parallel to the long axis of the fibril. In the channels, ThT may bind in either a monomeric or dimeric form of which the molecular conformation is likely to be planar. CR may bind in grooves formed along the {$\beta$}-sheets as a planar molecule in either a monomeric or supramolecular form.},

  abstract = {Thioflavin T (ThT) dye fluorescence is used regularly to quantify the formation and inhibition of amyloid fibrils in the presence of anti-amyloidogenic compounds such as polyphenols. However, in this study, it was shown, using three polyphenolics (curcumin, quercetin and resveratrol), that ThT fluorescence should be used with caution in the presence of such exogenous compounds. The strong absorptive and fluorescent properties of quercetin and curcumin were found to significantly bias the ThT fluorescence readings in both in~situ real-time ThT assays and single time-point dilution ThT-type assays. The presence of curcumin at concentrations as low as 0.01 and 1~{$\mu$}m was sufficient to interfere with the ThT fluorescence associated with fibrillar amyloid-{$\beta$}(1-42) (0.5~{$\mu$}m) and fibrillar reduced and carboxymethylated {$\kappa$}-casein (50~{$\mu$}m), respectively. The ThT fluorescence associated with fibrillar amyloid-{$\beta$}(1-42) was also biased using higher concentrations of resveratrol, a polyphenol that is not spectroscopically active at the wavelengths of ThT fluorescence, implying that there can be direct interactions between ThT and the exogenous compound and/or competitive binding with ThT for the fibrils. Thus, in all cases where ThT is used in the presence of an exogenous compound, biases for amyloid-associated ThT fluorescence should be tested, regardless of whether the additive is spectroscopically active. Simple methods to conduct these tests were described. The Congo red spectral shift assay is demonstrated as a more viable spectrophotometric alternative to ThT, but allied methods, such as transmission electron microscopy, should also be used to assess fibril formation independently of dye-based assays.

The measurement volume where the molecules are excited, and from which the fluorescence is detected, was scanned in a circle with radius comparable to its size at frequencies 0.5\textendash{}2 kHz. The scan radius R, determined with high accuracy by careful calibration, provides the spatial measure required for the determination of the diffusion coefficient D, without the need to know the exact size of the measurement volume. The difficulties in the determination of the measurement volume size have limited the application of standard FCS with fixed measurement volume to relative measurements, where the diffusion coefficient is determined by comparison with a standard. We demonstrate, on examples of several common fluorescent dyes, that sFCS can be used to measure D with high precision without a need for a standard. The correct value of D can be determined in the presence of weak photobleaching, and when the measurement volume size is modified, indicating the robustness of the method. The applicability of the presented implementation of sFCS to biological systems in demonstrated on the measurement of the diffusion coefficient of eGFP in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. With the help of simulations, we find the optimal value of the scan radius R for the experiment.},

The nuclear pore complex (NPC), composed of {$\sim$}30 different nucleoporins (Nups), is one of the largest supramolecular structures in eukaryotic cells. Its octagonal ring scaffold perforates the nuclear envelope and features a unique molecular machinery that regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport. However, the precise copy number and the spatial location of each Nup in the native NPC remain obscure due to the inherent difficulty of counting and localizing proteins inside of the sub-micrometer supramolecular complex. Here, we combined super-resolution single-point edge-excitation subdiffraction (SPEED) microscopy and nanobody-specific labeling to reveal the spatial distribution of scaffold Nups within three separate layers in the native NPC with a precision of {$\sim$}3 nm. Our data reveal both the radial and axial spatial distributions for Pom121, Nup37 and Nup35 and provide evidence for their copy numbers of 8, 32 and 16, respectively, per NPC. This approach can help pave the path for mapping the entirety of Nups in native NPCs and also other structural components of macromolecular complexes.},

  abstract = {Summary
Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. The mechanism(s) by which mutant HTT (mHTT) causes disease is unclear. Nucleocytoplasmic transport, the trafficking of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, is tightly regulated by nuclear pore~complexes (NPCs) made up of nucleoporins (NUPs). Previous studies offered clues that mHTT may disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport and a mutation of an NUP can cause HD-like pathology. Therefore, we evaluated the NPC and nucleocytoplasmic transport in multiple models of HD, including mouse and fly models, neurons transfected with mHTT, HD iPSC-derived neurons, and human HD brain regions. These studies revealed severe mislocalization and aggregation of NUPs and defective nucleocytoplasmic transport. HD repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation proteins also disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport. Additionally, overexpression of NUPs and treatment with drugs that prevent aberrant NUP biology also mitigated this transport defect and neurotoxicity, providing future novel therapy targets.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of cross-{$\beta$}-sheet amyloid fibrils is the hallmark of amyloid diseases. Recently, we reported the discovery of amyloid disaggregase activities in extracts from mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans. However, we have discovered a problem with the interpretation of our previous results as A{$\beta$} disaggregation in vitro. Here, we show that A{$\beta$} fibrils adsorb to the plastic surface of multiwell plates and Eppendorf tubes. This adsorption is markedly increased in the presence of complex biological mixtures subjected to a denaturing air-water interface. The time-dependent loss of thioflavin T fluorescence that we interpreted previously as disaggregation is due to increased adsorption of A{$\beta$} amyloid to the surfaces of multiwell plates and Eppendorf tubes in the presence of biological extracts. As the proteins in biological extracts denature over time at the air-water interface due to agitation/shaking, their adsorption increases, in turn promoting adsorption of amyloid fibrils. We delineate important control experiments that quantify the extent of amyloid adsorption to the surface of plastic and quartz containers. Based on the results described in this article, we conclude that our interpretation of the kinetic fibril disaggregation assay data previously reported in Bieschke et al., Protein Sci 2009;18:2231\textendash{}2241 and Murray et al., Protein Sci 2010;19:836\textendash{}846 is invalid when used as evidence for a disaggregase activity. Thus, we correct the two prior publications reporting that worm or mammalian cell extracts disaggregate A{$\beta$} amyloid fibrils in vitro at 37\textdegree{}C (see Corrigenda in this issue of Protein Science). We apologize for misinterpreting our previous data and for any confounding experimental efforts this may have caused.},

The maximum degree of swelling of the network in contact with the pure solvent is related to the degree of cross-linking.

Here, we have modeled the effect of NTRs on polymeric structure in the nanopore confinement of the NPC central conduit. The model explicitly takes into account inter- and intramolecular interactions, as well as the finite size of the NTRs ({$\sim$}20\% of the NPC channel diameter). It reproduces various proposed scenarios for the channel structure, ranging from a central polymer condensate (selective phase) to brushlike polymer arrangements localized at the channel wall (virtual gate, reduction of dimensionality), with the transport receptors lining the polymer surface. In addition, it predicts a new structure in which NTRs become an integral part of the transport barrier by forming a cross-linked network with the unstructured proteins stretching across the pore. The model provides specific and distinctive predictions for the equilibrium spatial distributions of NTRs for these different scenarios that can be experimentally verified by, e.g., superresolution fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, it suggests mechanisms by which globular macromolecules (colloidal particles) can cause polymer-coated nanopores to switch between open and closed configurations, a possible explanation of the biological function of the NPC, and suggests potential technological applications for filtration and single-molecule sensing.},

  abstract = {The study of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a fascinating endeavor, as it not only implies uncovering the `engineering marvel' of its architecture and function, but also provides a key window into a significant evolutionary event: the origin of the eukaryotic cell. The combined efforts of many groups in the field, with the help of novel methodologies and new model organisms, are facilitating a much deeper understanding of this complex assembly. Here we cover recent advances on the characterization of the structure of the NPC scaffold and of the biophysical mechanisms that define the permeability barrier. We identify common architectural and functional principles between those two NPC compartments, expanding the previous protocoatomer hypothesis to suggest possible evolutionary origins for the FG nucleoporins and the NPC permeability barrier.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) lack a well-defined 3D-structure under physiological conditions, yet, the inherent disorder represented by an ensemble of conformation plays a critical role in many cellular and regulatory processes. Nucleoporins, or Nups, are the proteins found in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The central pore of the NPC is occupied by Nups, which have phenylalanine-glycine domain repeats and are intrinsically disordered, and therefore are termed FG-Nups. These FG-domain repeats exhibit differing cohesiveness character and differ from least (FG) to most (GLFG) cohesive. The designed FG-Nup is a 25 AA model peptide containing a noncohesive FG-motif flanked by two cohesive GLFG-motifs (WT peptide). Complete NMR-based ensemble characterization of this peptide along with a control peptide with an F{$>$}A substitution (MU peptide) are discussed. Ensemble characterization of the NMR-determined models suggests that both the peptides do not have consistent secondary structures and continue to be disordered. Nonetheless, the role of cohesive elements mediated by the GLFG motifs is evident in the WT ensemble of structures that are more compact than the MU peptide. The approach presented here allows an alternate way to investigate the specific roles of distinct amino acid motifs that translate into the long-range organization of the ensemble of structures and in general on the nature of IDPs.},

In this study, we expressed individual Nups fused with a crowding-sensitive probe (GimRET) to determine the spatial distribution of protein-rich domains within the central channel in vivo, and characterize the properties of the entropic barrier. Analyses of the probe signal revealed that the central channel contains two protein-rich domains at both the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic peripheries, and a less-crowded central cavity. Karyopherins and other soluble proteins are not the constituents of the protein-rich domains. The time-lapse observation of the post-mitotic reassembly process also revealed how individual protein-rich domains are constructed by a sequential assembly of nucleoporins.},

The observed strong dependence on illumination side of the reflectance and absorptance, attributed to driving field effects, is reproduced very well. Thin-film silicon solar cells with embedded silver island films were fabricated and it was found that their performance is reduced due to parasitic absorption of light in the silver island film. Simulations of these solar cells, where the silver island film is represented as an effective medium layer, show a similar trend. This highlights the importance of minimizing parasitic absorption.},

  abstract = {The transport channel of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) contains a high density of intrinsically disordered proteins that are rich in phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat motifs (FG Nups). The FG Nups interact promiscuously with various nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), such as karyopherins (Kaps), that mediate the trafficking of nucleocytoplasmic cargoes while also generating a selectively permeable barrier against other macromolecules. Although the binding of NTRs to FG Nups increases molecular crowding in the NPC transport channel, it is unclear how this impacts FG Nup barrier function or the movement of other molecules, such as the Ran importer NTF2. Here, we use surface plasmon resonance to evaluate FG Nup conformation, binding equilibria, and interaction kinetics associated with the multivalent binding of NTF2 and karyopherin{$\beta$}1 (Kap{$\beta$}1) to Nsp1p molecular brushes. NTF2 and Kap{$\beta$}1 show different long- and short-lived binding characteristics that emerge from varying degrees of molecular retention and FG repeat binding avidity within the Nsp1p brush. Physiological concentrations of NTF2 produce a collapse of Nsp1p brushes, whereas Kap{$\beta$}1 binding generates brush extension. However, the presence of prebound Kap{$\beta$}1 inhibits Nsp1p brush collapse during NTF2 binding, which is dominated by weak, short-lived interactions that derive from steric hindrance and diminished avidity with Nsp1p. This suggests that binding promiscuity confers kinetic advantages to NTF2 by expediting its facilitated diffusion and reinforces the proposal that Kap{$\beta$}1 contributes to the integral barrier function of the NPC.},

A highly relevant biological example of such a phenomenon is the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) found perforating the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells. In the central conduit of the NPC, of {$\sim$}30\textendash{}60 nm diameter, a disordered network of proteins regulates all macromolecular transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In spite of a wealth of experimental data, the selectivity barrier of the NPC has yet to be explained fully. Experimental and theoretical approaches are complicated by the disordered and heterogeneous nature of the NPC conduit. Modelling approaches have focused on the behaviour of the partially unfolded protein domains in the confined geometry of the NPC conduit, and have demonstrated that within the range of parameters thought relevant for the NPC, widely varying behaviour can be observed. In this review, we summarise recent efforts to physically model the NPC barrier and function. We illustrate how attempts to understand NPC barrier function have employed many different modelling techniques, each of which have contributed to our understanding of the NPC.},

Current FG-centric views reason that selective Kap translocation is promoted by alterations in the barrier-like FG Nup conformations. However, the strong binding of Kaps with the FG Nups due to avidity contradicts rapid Kap translocation in~vivo. Here, using surface plasmon resonance, we innovate a means to correlate in~situ mechanistic (molecular occupancy and conformational changes) with equilibrium (binding affinity) and kinetic (multivalent binding kinetics) aspects of Karyopherin{$\beta$}1 (Kap{$\beta$}1) binding to four different FG Nups. A~general feature of the FxFG domains of Nup214, Nup62, and Nup153 is their capacity to extend and accommodate large numbers of Kap{$\beta$}1 molecules at physiological Kap{$\beta$}1 concentrations. A notable exception is the GLFG domain of Nup98, which forms a partially penetrable cohesive layer. Interestingly, we find that a slowly exchanging Kap{$\beta$}1 phase forms an integral constituent within the FG Nups that coexists with a fast phase, which dominates transport kinetics due to limited binding with the pre-occupied FG Nups at physiological Kap{$\beta$}1 concentrations. Altogether, our data reveal an emergent Kap-centric barrier mechanism that may underlie mechanistic and kinetic control in the nuclear pore complex.},

Here, we found that phenylalanine-mediated inter-repeat interactions indeed cross-link FG-repeat domains into elastic and reversible hydrogels. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that such hydrogel formation is required for viability in yeast.
The sieve-like mesh within the pores in the nuclear membrane is a reversible protein hydrogel, with hydrophobic bridges connecting polypeptide chains.

  abstract = {The selectivity and speed of many biological transport processes transpire from a `reduction of dimensionality' that confines diffusion to one or two dimensions instead of three. This behaviour remains highly sought after on polymeric surfaces as a means to expedite diffusional search processes in molecular engineered systems. Here, we have reconstituted the two-dimensional diffusion of colloidal particles on a molecular brush surface. The surface is composed of phenylalanine-glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups)\textemdash{}intrinsically disordered proteins that facilitate selective transport through nuclear pore complexes in eukaryotic cells. Local and ensemble-level experiments involving optical trapping using a photonic force microscope and particle tracking by video microscopy, respectively, reveal that 1-{$\mathrm{\mu}$}m-sized colloidal particles bearing nuclear transport receptors called karyopherins can exhibit behaviour that varies from highly localized to unhindered two-dimensional diffusion. Particle diffusivity is controlled by varying the amount of free karyopherins in solution, which modulates the multivalency of Kap-binding sites within the molecular brush. We conclude that the FG Nups resemble stimuli-responsive molecular `velcro', which can impart `reduction of dimensionality' as a means of biomimetic transport control in artificial environments.},

The passage of the Xpo1p nuclear export complex through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is facilitated by interactions with nucleoporins (Nups) containing extensive repeats of phenylalanine\textendash{}glycine (so-called FG repeats), although the precise role of each Nup in the nuclear export reaction remains incompletely understood. Here we report structural and biochemical characterization of the interactions between the Xpo1p nuclear export complex and the FG repeats of Nup42p, a nucleoporin localized at the cytoplasmic face of yeast NPCs and has characteristic SxFG/PxFG sequence repeat motif. The crystal structure of Xpo1p-PKI-Nup42p-Gsp1p-GTP complex identified three binding sites for the SxFG/PxFG repeats on HEAT repeats 14\textendash{}20 of Xpo1p. Mutational analyses of Nup42p showed that the conserved serines and prolines in the SxFG/PxFG repeats contribute to Xpo1p-Nup42p binding. Our structural and biochemical data suggest that SxFG/PxFG-Nups such as Nup42p and Nup159p at the cytoplasmic face of NPCs provide high-affinity docking sites for the Xpo1p nuclear export complex in the terminal stage of NPC passage and that subsequent disassembly of the nuclear export complex facilitates recycling of free Xpo1p back to the nucleus.},

In cultured hippocampal neurons, we observed an ankyrin G- and F-actin-dependent structure that emerged in the cytoplasm of the axon initial segment (AIS) within 2 days after axon/dendrite differentiation, imposing a selective filter for diffusion of macromolecules and transport of vesicular carriers into the axon. Axonal entry was allowed for KIF5-driven carriers of synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2, but not for KIF17-driven carriers of dendrite-targeting NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. Comparisons of transport rates between chimeric forms of KIF17 and KIF5B, with the motor and cargo-binding domains switched, and between KIF5 loaded with VAMP2 versus GluR2 suggest that axonal entry of vesicular carriers depends on the transport efficacy of KIF-cargo complexes. This selective AIS filtering may contribute to preferential trafficking and segregation of cellular components in polarized neurons.},

Macromolecular crowding created by various macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates has been shown to have a significant effect on a variety of cellular processes including protein aggregation. Most studies of macromolecular crowding have used neutral, flexible polysaccharides that function primarily via excluded volume effect as model crowding agents. Here we have examined the effects of more rigid polysaccharides on protein structure and aggregation. Our results indicate that rigid and flexible polysaccharides influence protein aggregation via different mechanisms and suggest that, in addition to excluded volume effect, changes in solution viscosity and non-specific protein\textendash{}polymer interactions influence the structure and dynamics of proteins in crowded environments.},

  abstract = {The study of drug candidates for the treatment of amyloidosis and neurodegenerative diseases frequently involves in vitro measurements of amyloid fibril formation. Macromolecular crowding and off-pathway aggregation (OPA) are, by different reasons, two important phenomena affecting the scalability of amyloid inhibitors and their successful application in vivo. On the one hand, the cellular milieu is crowded with macromolecules that drastically increase the effective (thermodynamic) concentration of the amyloidogenic protein. On the other hand, off-pathway aggregates, rather than amyloid fibrils, are increasingly appointed as causative agents of toxicity. The present contribution reveals that insoluble off-pathway aggregates of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) are a peculiar type of crowding agents that, unlike classical macromolecular crowders, decrease the thermodynamic concentration of protein. Illustrating this effect, OPA is shown to resume after lowering the fraction of insoluble aggregates at a constant soluble HEWL concentration. Protein depletion and thioflavin-T fluorescence progress curves indicate that OPA rebirth is not accompanied by additional amyloid fibril formation. The crystallization-like model extended to account for OPA and time-dependent activity coefficients is able to fit multiple kinetic results using a single set of three parameters describing amyloid nucleation, autocatalytic growth, and off-pathway nucleation. The list of fitted results notably includes the cases of aggregation rebirth and all types of progress curves measured for different HEWL concentrations. The quantitative challenges posed by macromolecular crowding and OPA find here a unified response with broader implications for the development of on- and off-pathway inhibitors.},

In the present study, we examined the effects of preformed seeds on lysozyme amyloid fibrillation in the presence of two distinct inhibitors\textendash{}epigallocatechin (EGC) and polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG). The results demonstrated that the effects of fibrillar seeds on the acceleration of lysozyme fibrillation depended on the aggregation pathway directed by an inhibitor. EGC inhibited lysozyme fibrillation and modified the peptide chains with quinone moieties in a concentration-dependent manner. The resulting aggregates showed amorphous off-pathway morphology. Preformed fibril seeds did not promote lysozyme fibrillation in the presence of EGC. PEG also inhibited lysozyme fibrillation, and the resulting aggregates showed on-pathway protofibrillar morphology. In contrast, the addition of fibril seeds into the mixture of lysozyme and PEG significantly stimulated fibril growth. Assays of cell viability showed that both EGC and PEG inhibited the formation of cytotoxic species. In accordance with thioflavine T data, the seeds failed to alter the cell-damaging potency of the EGC-directed off-pathway aggregates, but increased the cytotoxicity of the PEG-directed on-pathway fibrils. We suggest that the pattern of interaction between lysozyme and an inhibitor determines the pathway of aggregation and therefore the effects of seeding on amyloid formation. EGC covalently modified lysozyme chains with quinones, directing the aggregation to proceed through an off-pathway, whereas PEG affected the protein in a noncovalent manner, and fibril growth could be stimulated under seeding through an on-pathway.},

However, how macromolecular crowding affects amyloid formation of {$\beta$}2M remains elusive. Here we study the effects of macromolecular crowding on amyloid formation and fibril disassembly of wild-type human {$\beta$}2M and its pathogenic mutant {$\Delta$}N6. At strongly acidic pH2.5, the presence of a strong crowding agent (Ficoll 70 or dextran 70) not only dramatically accelerates the fibrillization of both wild-type {$\beta$}2M and its {$\Delta$}N6 variant by reducing the lag time to a large extent, indicating the acceleration of the nucleation phase, but also remarkably increases the amount of {$\beta$}2M fibrils. At weakly acidic pH6.2, such an enhancing effect of macromolecular crowding on fibril formation is only observed for pathogenic mutant {$\Delta$}N6, but not for wild-type {$\beta$}2M which does not form amyloid fibrils in the absence and presence of a crowding agent. Thus, we propose that the monomers of {$\beta$}2M form the nuclei, which is enhanced by macromolecular crowding, followed by the step of fibril elongation. Furthermore, at physiological pH, macromolecular crowding remarkably inhibits {$\beta$}2M fibril disassembly by decreasing rate constants corresponding to fast and slow stages of fibril disaggregation. Our data demonstrate that macromolecular crowding favors the fibrillization of {$\beta$}2M by accelerating the nucleation step and inhibiting fibril disassembly. Our findings provide clear evidence for the pathology of HAA that macromolecular crowding should be taken into account.},

The observed inconsistencies are commonly explained by the so-called soft interactions, such as electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions, between the crowding agent and the protein, in addition to the hard nonspecific steric interactions. We suggest that the changes in the solvent properties of aqueous media induced by the crowding agents may be the root of these ``soft'' interactions. To check this hypothesis, the solvatochromic comparison method was used to determine the solvent dipolarity/polarizability, hydrogen-bond donor acidity, and hydrogen-bond acceptor basicity of aqueous solutions of different polymers (dextran, poly(ethylene glycol), Ficoll, Ucon, and polyvinylpyrrolidone) with the polymer concentration up to 40\% typically used as crowding agents. Polymer-induced changes in these features were found to be polymer type and concentration specific, and, in case of polyethylene glycol (PEG), molecular mass specific. Similarly sized polymers PEG and Ucon producing different changes in the solvent properties of water in their solutions induced morphologically different {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregates. It is shown that the crowding effects of some polymers on protein refolding and stability reported in the literature can be quantitatively described in terms of the established solvent features of the media in these polymers solutions. These results indicate that the crowding agents do induce changes in solvent properties of aqueous media in crowded environment. Therefore, these changes should be taken into account for crowding effect analysis.},

The polymers we chose were polyethylene glycol (PEG) and UCON (1:1 copolymer of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol). The presence of additional methyl groups in UCON makes it more hydrophobic than PEG. Our earlier analysis revealed that similarly sized PEG and UCON produced different changes in the solvent properties of water in their solutions and induced morphologically different {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregates [Ferreira, L. A., et al. (2015) Role of solvent properties of aqueous media in macromolecular crowding effects. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn., in press]. To improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms defining behavior of proteins in a crowded environment, we tested the effects of these polymers on secondary and tertiary structure and aromatic residue solvent accessibility of 10 proteins [five folded proteins, two hybrid proteins; i.e., protein containing ordered and disordered domains, and three intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)] and on the aggregation kinetics of insulin and {$\alpha$}-synuclein. We found that effects of both polymers on secondary and tertiary structures of folded and hybrid proteins were rather limited with slight unfolding observed in some cases. Solvent accessibility of aromatic residues was significantly increased for the majority of the studied proteins in the presence of UCON but not PEG. PEG also accelerated the aggregation of protein into amyloid fibrils, whereas UCON promoted aggregation to amyloid oligomers instead. These results indicate that even a relatively small change in polymer structure leads to a significant change in the effect of this polymer on protein folding and aggregation. This is an indication that protein folding and especially aggregation are highly sensitive to the presence of other macromolecules, and an excluded volume effect is insufficient to describe their effect.},

  abstract = {Amyloid formation and accumulation is a hallmark of protein misfolding diseases and is associated with diverse pathologies including type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro, amyloidogenesis is widely studied in conditions that do not simulate the crowded and viscous in vivo environment. A high volume fraction of most biological fluids is occupied by various macromolecules, a phenomenon known as macromolecular crowding. For some amyloid systems (e.g. {$\alpha$}-synuclein) and under shaking condition, the excluded volume effect of macromolecular crowding favors aggregation, whereas increased viscosity reduces the kinetics of these reactions. Amyloidogenesis can also be catalyzed by hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, represented by the air-water interface in vitro and diverse heterogeneous interfaces in vivo (e.g. membranes). In this study, we investigated the effects of two different crowding polymers (dextran and Ficoll) and two different experimental conditions (with and without shaking) on the fibrilization of amyloid-{$\beta$} peptide, a major player in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, we demonstrate that, during macromolecular crowding, viscosity dominates over the excluded volume effect only when the system is spatially non homogeneous (i.e. an air-water interface is present). We also show that the surfactant activity of the crowding agents can critically influence the outcome of macromolecular crowding and that the structure of the amyloid species formed may depend on the polymer used. This suggests that, in vivo, the outcome of amyloidogenesis may be affected by both macromolecular crowding and spatial heterogeneity (e.g. membrane turn-over). More generally, our work suggests that any factors causing changes in crowding may be susceptibility factors in AD.},

To this end, the dependencies of the ThT quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime on temperature and glycerol content in the water-glycerol mixtures are studied. It has been found that fluorescent properties of ThT are typical for the specific class of fluorophores known as molecular rotors. It has been established that the low ThT fluorescence intensity in the solvents with low viscosity is caused by the nonradiative deactivation of the excited state associated with the torsional motion of the ThT benzthiazole and aminobenzene rings relative to each other, which results in the transition of ThT molecule to nonfluorescent twisted internal charge transfer (TICT) state. The rate of this process is determined by the solvent viscosity, whereas the emission does occur from the nonequilibrium locally excited (LE) state. High polarization degree of the ThT fluorescence (P = 0.45) observed for glycerol solutions of different viscosity confirms the nonequilibrium character of the emission from the LE state and testifies that rotational correlation time of the whole molecule is considerably greater than the time required to accomplish transition to the nonfluorescent TICT state. Torsional movements of the ThT fragments take place in the same temporal interval as solvent relaxation, which leads to nonexponential fluorescence decay of the dye in viscous solvents. This photophysical model successfully explains the fluorescent properties of ThT in solvents with different viscosities. The model is confirmed by the results of the quantum-chemical calculations, which showed that energy minimum for the ground state of ThT corresponds to conformation with torsional angle {$\varphi$} = 37\textdegree{} between the benzthiazole and aminobenzene rings and in the excited-state twisted conformation of ThT with {$\varphi$} = 90\textdegree{} has minimal energy. These data support the idea that the reason for the characteristic increase in the ThT fluorescence intensity accompanying its incorporation into the amyloid fibrils is determined by the rigidity of the dye environment, which prevents the rotation of the benzthiazole ring relative to the aminobenzene ring in the excited state.},

  abstract = {Macromolecular crowding is expected to have several significant effects on protein aggregation; the major effects will be those due to excluded volume and increased viscosity. In this report we summarize data demonstrating that macromolecular crowding may lead to a dramatic acceleration in the rate of protein aggregation and formation of amyloid fibrils, using the protein {$\alpha$}-synuclein. The aggregation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein has been implicated as a critical factor in development of Parkinson's disease. Various types of polymers, from neutral polyethylene glycols and polysaccharides (Ficolls, dextrans) to inert proteins, are shown to accelerate {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibrillation. The stimulation of fibrillation increases with increasing length of polymer, as well as increasing polymer concentration. At lower polymer concentrations (typically up to {$\sim$}100\,mg/ml) the major effect is ascribed to excluded volume, whereas at higher polymer concentrations evidence of opposing viscosity effects become apparent. Pesticides and metals, which are linked to increased risk of Parkinson's disease by epidemiological studies, are shown to accelerate {$\alpha$}-synuclein fibrillation under conditions of molecular crowding.

Summary

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are fundamental components of the eukaryotic cell. They perforate the nuclear envelope and serve as highly selective transport gates that enable bi-directional macromolecule exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Recent studies illustrate that the NPC is not a static structural channel but a flexible environment and strategic player during nuclear signaling. The constitutional and conformational dynamics of the NPC allow it to tailor nucleocytoplasmic transport activities and define specific signaling output in response to various cellular and environmental cues. In this Insight, we review the roles of NPC constituents in immune activation and hormone signaling in plants, and discuss the possible role of the NPC as a legitimate platform for regulating cell signaling.},

  abstract = {Nucleocytoplasmic transport is sustained by karyopherins (Kaps) and a Ran guanosine triphosphate (RanGTP) gradient that imports nuclear localization signal (NLS)\textendash{}specific cargoes (NLS-cargoes) into the nucleus. However, how nuclear pore complex (NPC) barrier selectivity, Kap traffic, and NLS-cargo release are systematically linked and simultaneously regulated remains incoherent. In this study, we show that Kap{$\alpha$} facilitates Kap{$\beta$}1 turnover and occupancy at the NPC in a RanGTP-dependent manner that is directly coupled to NLS-cargo release and NPC barrier function. This is underpinned by the binding affinity of Kap{$\beta$}1 to phenylalanine\textendash{}glycine nucleoporins (FG Nups), which is comparable with RanGTP{$\cdot$}Kap{$\beta$}1, but stronger for Kap{$\alpha\cdot$}Kap{$\beta$}1. On this basis, RanGTP is ineffective at releasing standalone Kap{$\beta$}1 from NPCs. Depleting Kap{$\alpha\cdot$}Kap{$\beta$}1 by RanGTP further abrogates NPC barrier function, whereas adding back Kap{$\beta$}1 rescues it while Kap{$\beta$}1 turnover softens it. Therefore, the FG Nups are necessary but insufficient for NPC barrier function. We conclude that Kaps constitute integral constituents of the NPC whose barrier, transport, and cargo release functionalities establish a continuum under a mechanism of Kap-centric control.},

  abstract = {The phenylalanine-glycine\textendash{}repeat nucleoporins (FG-Nups), which occupy the lumen of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), are critical for transport between the nucleus and cytosol. Although NPCs differ in composition across species, they are largely conserved in organization and function. Transport through the pore is on the millisecond timescale. Here, to explore the dynamics of nucleoporins on this timescale, we use coarse-grained computational simulations. These simulations generate predictions that can be experimentally tested to distinguish between proposed mechanisms of transport. Our model reflects the conserved structure of the NPC, in which FG-Nup filaments extend into the lumen and anchor along the interior of the channel. The lengths of the filaments in our model are based on the known characteristics of yeast FG-Nups. The FG-repeat sites also bind to each other, and we vary this association over several orders of magnitude and run 100-ms simulations for each value. The autocorrelation functions of the orientation of the simulated FG-Nups are compared with in vivo anisotropy data. We observe that FG-Nups reptate back and forth through the NPC at timescales commensurate with experimental measurements of the speed of cargo transport through the NPC. Our results are consistent with models of transport where FG-Nup filaments are free to move across the central channel of the NPC, possibly informing how cargo might transverse the NPC.},

We add glycerol to vary solvent viscosity and demonstrate that glycerol effects on the activation barrier for attachment of molecules to the crystal growth sites are minimal. We separate the effects of glycerol on crystallization thermodynamics from those on the rate constant for molecular attachment. We establish that the rate constant is proportional to the reciprocal viscosity and to the protein diffusivity. This finding refutes the prevailing crystal growth paradigm and illustrates the application of fundamental kinetics laws to solution crystallization.},

This has challenged our understanding of how they serve to selectively facilitate translocation of nuclear transport receptor (NTR)-bearing macromolecules. Heterogeneous FG-repeats, tethered to the NPC interior, nonuniformly fill the channel in a diameter-dependent manner and adopt a rapid Brownian motion, thereby forming a porous and highly dynamic polymeric meshwork that percolates in radial and axial directions and features two distinguishable zones: a dense hydrophobic rod-like zone located in the center, and a peripheral low-density shell-like zone. The FG-meshwork is locally disrupted upon interacting with NTR-bearing macromolecules, but immediately reconstructs itself between 0.44\,{$\mu$}s and 7.0\,{$\mu$}s, depending on cargo size and shape. This confers a perpetually-sealed state to the NPC, and is solely due to rapid Brownian motion of FG-repeats, not FG-repeat hydrophobic bonds. Elongated-shaped macromolecules, both in the presence and absence of NTRs, penetrate more readily into the FG-meshwork compared to their globular counterparts of identical volume and surface chemistry, highlighting the importance of the shape effects in nucleocytoplasmic transport. These results can help our understanding of geometrical effects in, and the design of, intelligent and responsive biopolymer-based materials in nanofiltration and artificial nanopores.},

Provocative predictions of a simple model were tested using cell-free nuclei reconstituted in Xenopus egg extract, a system well suited to quantitative studies. We found that accumulation capacity is limited, so that introduction of one import cargo leads to egress of another. Clearly, the pore per se does not determine transport directionality. Moreover, different cargo reach a similar ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic concentration in steady-state. The model shows that this ratio should in fact be independent of the receptor-cargo affinity, though kinetics may be strongly influenced. Numerical conservation of the system components highlights a conflict between the observations and the popular concept of transport cycles. We suggest that chemical partitioning provides a framework to understand the capacity to generate concentration gradients by equilibration of the receptor-cargo intermediary.},

  abstract = {The 62 kDa FG repeat domain of the nucleoporin Nsp1p forms a hydrogel-based, sieve-like permeability barrier that excludes inert macromolecules but allows rapid entry of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). We found that the N-terminal part of this domain, which is characterized by Asn-rich inter-FG spacers, forms a tough hydrogel. The C-terminal part comprises charged inter-FG spacers, shows low gelation propensity on its own, but binds the N-terminal part and passivates the FG hydrogel against nonselective interactions. It was previously shown that a hydrophobic collapse involving Phe residues is required for FG hydrogel formation. Using solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we now identified two additional types of intragel interactions, namely, transient hydrophobic interactions between Phe and methyl side chains as well as intermolecular {$\beta$}-sheets between the Asn-rich spacer regions. The latter appear to be the kinetically most stable structures within the FG hydrogel. They are also a central feature of neuronal inclusions formed by Asn/Gln-rich amyloid and prion proteins. The cohesive properties of FG repeats and the Asn/Gln-rich domain from the yeast prion Sup35p appear indeed so similar to each other that these two modules interact in trans. Our data, therefore, suggest a fully unexpected cellular function of such interchain {$\beta$}-structures in maintaining the permeability barrier of nuclear pores. They provide an explanation for how contacts between FG repeats might gain the kinetic stability to suppress passive fluxes through nuclear pores and yet allow rapid NTR passage.},

We investigated the use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a porogen to enhance diffusion of macromolecules into the interior of polyacrylamide and PEG hydrogel posts photopatterned within microfluidic channels. The diffusion of GST-GFP and dextran-FITC into hydrogels was monitored and effective diffusion coefficients were determined by fitting to the Fickian diffusion equations. PEG-diacrylate (Mr 700) with porogen formed a macroporous structure and permitted significant penetration of 250 kDa dextran. Proteins copolymerized in these macroporous hydrogels retained activity and were more accessible to antibody binding than proteins copolymerized in nonporous gels. These results suggest that hydrogel macroporosity can be tuned to regulate macromolecular transport in applications such as tissue engineering and protein arrays.},

The mass ratio range of sodium alginate:CaCl2:cationic polymer (poly-l-lysine [PLL] or chitosan) to prepare nanospheres was 100:17:10. This mass ratio ensured that the calcium alginate was maintained in the pre-gel phase and sufficient cationic polymer was present to form nanospheres. At low cationic polymer concentrations, nanospheres were not formed, whereas microspheres were formed at higher concentrations. The release of entrapped methylene blue from the nanospheres was directly proportional (R2=0.98) to the sodium chloride concentration in the dissolution medium. The sodium ions more efficiently displace PLL compared to chitosan; hence, the mass of drug released from the chitosan\textendash{}alginate nanospheres is slow for equivalent sodium ion concentration. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies determined that the primary binding affinity between calcium and alginate was 1.33\texttimes{}106/mole and entropically driven, whereas, the second binding affinity was weaker (1.03\texttimes{}104/mole) and driven by both enthalpy and entropy. This binding was competitively inhibited by sodium ions. Similarly, the binding of PLL to calcium alginate pre-gel was electrostatic and competitively inhibited by sodium, although, the thermodynamic parameters for this interaction could not be determined.},

  abstract = {Background Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate bidirectional transport of proteins, RNAs, and ribonucleoproteins across the double-membrane nuclear envelope. Although there are many studies that look at the traffic in the nucleus and through the nuclear envelope we propose a method to detect the nucleocytoplasmic transport kinetics in an unperturbed cell, with no requirement for specific labeling of isolated molecules and, most important, in the presence of the cell milieu.  Methodology The pair correlation function method (pCF) measures the time a molecule takes to migrate from one location to another within the cell in the presence of many molecules of the same kind. The spatial and temporal correlation among two arbitrary points in the cell provides a local map of molecular transport, and also highlights the presence of barriers to diffusion with millisecond time resolution and spatial resolution limited by diffraction. We use the pair correlation method to monitor a model protein substrate undergoing transport through NPCs in living cells, a biological problem in which single particle tracking (SPT) has given results that cannot be confirmed by traditional single-point FCS measurements because of the lack of spatial resolution.  Conclusions We show that obstacles to molecular flow can be detected and that the pCF algorithm can recognize the heterogeneity of protein intra-compartment diffusion as well as the presence of barriers to transport across NE.},

Altered nuclear size is associated with many cancers, and determining whether cancer-associated changes in nuclear size contribute to carcinogenesis necessitates an understanding of mechanisms of nuclear size regulation. Although nuclear import rates generally positively correlate with nuclear size, NTF2 levels negatively affect nuclear size, despite the role of NTF2 (also known as NUTF2) in nuclear recycling of the import factor Ran. We show that binding of Ran to NTF2 is required for NTF2 to inhibit nuclear expansion and import of large cargo molecules in Xenopus laevis egg and embryo extracts, consistent with our observation that NTF2 reduces the diameter of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in a Ran-binding-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ectopic NTF2 expression in Xenopus embryos and mammalian tissue culture cells alters nuclear size. Finally, we show that increases in nuclear size during melanoma progression correlate with reduced NTF2 expression, and increasing NTF2 levels in melanoma cells is sufficient to reduce nuclear size. These results show a conserved capacity for NTF2 to impact on nuclear size, and we propose that NTF2 might be a new cancer biomarker.},

Characterizing the permeability properties of such hydrogels is mandatory for the development of suitable drug delivery vectors and pharmaceutics. Here, we present an experimental method to measure bulk particle transport through hydrogels. We validate our assay by applying it to mucin hydrogels and show that the permeability properties of these mucin hydrogels can be modulated by polymer density and pH, in agreement with previous results obtained from single particle tracking. The method we present here is easy to handle, inexpensive, and high-throughput compatible. It is also a suitable platform for the design and screening of drugs that aim at modifying the barrier properties of hydrogels.

Biological gels such as mucus, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the biopolymer barrier within the nuclear pore are well suited to achieve such a selective exchange, allowing passage of particular molecules while rejecting many others. Although hydrogel-based filters are integral parts of biology, clear concepts of how their barrier function is controlled at a microscopic level are still missing. We summarize here our current understanding of how selective filtering is established by different biopolymer-based hydrogels.

In this study the possibilities offered by orderly TC arrays as created by laser microdrilling were explored. A theoretical framework was developed taking the convolution of membrane transport, solution change, and diffusion into account. The optical properties of orderly TC arrays were studied and the kinetics of solution change measured. Export and import through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) was analyzed in isolated envelopes of Xenopus oocyte nuclei. In accordance with previous reports nuclear transport receptor NTF2, which binds directly to NPC proteins, was found to be translocated much faster than ``inert'' molecules of similar size. Unexpectedly, NXT1, a homolog of NTF2 reportedly unable to bind to NPC proteins directly, was translocated as fast as NTF2. Thus, microstructured TC arrays were shown to provide optical single transporter recording with a new basis.},

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are {$\sim$}100 MDa transport channels assembled from multiple copies of {$\sim$}30 nucleoporins (Nups). One-third of these Nups contain phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-rich repeats, forming a diffusion barrier, which is selectively permeable for nuclear transport receptors that interact with these repeats. Here, we identify an additional function of FG repeats in the structure and biogenesis of the yeast NPC. We demonstrate that GLFG-containing FG repeats directly bind to multiple scaffold Nups in~vitro and act as NPC-targeting determinants in~vivo. Furthermore, we show that the GLFG repeats of Nup116 function in a redundant manner with Nup188, a nonessential scaffold Nup, to stabilize critical interactions within the NPC scaffold needed for late steps of NPC assembly. Our results reveal a previously unanticipated structural role for natively unfolded GLFG repeats as Velcro to link NPC subcomplexes and thus add a new layer of connections to current models of the NPC architecture.},

  abstract = {Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is a small, homodimeric protein that binds to both RanGDP and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins, such as yeast Nsp1p and vertebrate p62. NTF2 is required for efficient nuclear protein import and has been shown to mediate the nuclear import of RanGDP. We have used the crystal structures of rat NTF2 and its complex with RanGDP to design a mutant, W7A-NTF2, in which the affinity for xFxFG-repeat nucleoporins is reduced while wild-type binding to RanGDP is retained. The 2.5 \AA{} resolution crystal structure of W7A-NTF2 is virtually superimposable upon the wild-type protein structure, indicating that the mutation had not introduced a more general conformational change. Therefore, our data suggest that the exposed side-chain of residue 7 is crucial to the interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. Consistent with its reduced affinity for xFxFG nucleoporins, fluorescently labelled W7A-NTF2 binds less strongly to the nuclear envelope of permeabilized cultured cells than wild-type NTF2 and, when microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, colloidal gold coated with W7A-NTF2 binds less strongly to the central channel of nuclear pore complexes than wild-type NTF2-coated gold. Significantly, W7A-NTF2 only weakly stimulated the nuclear import of fluorescein-labelled RanGDP, providing direct evidence that an interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins is required to mediate the nuclear import of RanGDP.},

Here, we present a kinetic analysis of the process using various model substrates. We find that the translocation capacity of NPCs is unexpectedly high, with a single NPC allowing a mass flow of nearly 100~MDa/s and rates in the order of 103 translocation events per second.

We propose a `selective phase model' that could explain how NPCs function as a permeability barrier for inert molecules and yet become selectively permeable for nuclear transport receptors and receptor\textendash{}cargo complexes.},

The permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) controls the exchange between nucleus and cytoplasm. It suppresses the flux of inert macromolecules {$\geq$} 30 kDa but allows rapid passage of even very large cargoes, provided these are bound to appropriate nuclear transport receptors. We show here that a saturated hydrogel formed by a single nucleoporin FG-repeat domain is sufficient to reproduce the permeability properties of NPCs. Importin {$\beta$} and related nuclear transport receptors entered such hydrogel \&gt;1000\texttimes{} faster than a similarly sized inert macromolecule. The FG-hydrogel even reproduced import signal-dependent and importin-mediated cargo influx, allowing importin {$\beta$} to accelerate the gel entry of a large cognate cargo more than 20,000-fold. Intragel diffusion of the importin {$\beta$}-cargo complex occurred rapidly enough to traverse an NPC within {$\approx$}12 ms. We extend the ``selective phase model'' to explain these effects.},

A selective permeability barrier that arises from a supramolecular assembly of intrinsically unfolded nucleoporin domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine dipeptides (FG domains) fills the nuclear pore. There is increasing evidence that selective transport requires cohesive FG domain interactions. To understand the functional roles of cohesive interactions, we studied monolayers of end-grafted FG domains as a bottom-up nanoscale model system of the permeability barrier. Based on detailed physicochemical analysis of the model films and comparison of the data with polymer theory, we propose that cohesiveness is tuned to promote rapid assembly of the permeability barrier and to generate a stable and compact pore-filling meshwork with a small mesh size. Our results highlight the functional importance of weak interactions, typically a few kBT per chain, and contribute important information to understand the mechanism of size-selective transport.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a powerful technique to study molecular dynamics inside living cells. During the past years, several laboratories have used FRAP to image the motion of RNA-protein and other macromolecular complexes in the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the case of mRNAs, there is growing evidence indicating that these molecules assemble into large ribonucleoprotein complexes that diffuse throughout the nucleus by Brownian motion. However, estimates of the corresponding diffusion rate yielded values that differ by up to one order of magnitude. In vivo labeling of RNA relies on indirect tagging with a fluorescent probe, and here we show how the binding affinity of the probe to the target RNA influences the effective diffusion estimates of the resulting complex. We extend current reaction-diffusion models for FRAP by allowing for diffusion of the bound complex. This more general model can be used to fit any fluorescence recovery curve involving two interacting mobile species in the cell (a fluorescent probe and its target substrate). The results show that interpreting FRAP data in light of the new model reconciles the discrepant mRNA diffusion-rate values previously reported.},

The exact cargo spectrum of the majority of NTRs, their specificity and even the extent to which active nucleocytoplasmic transport contributes to protein localization remains understudied because of the transient nature of these interactions and the wide dynamic range of cargo concentrations. To systematically map cargo-NTR relationships in~situ, we used proximity ligation coupled to mass spectrometry (BioID). We systematically fused the engineered biotin ligase BirA* to 16 NTRs. We estimate that a considerable fraction of the human proteome is subject to active nuclear transport. We quantified the specificity and redundancy in NTR interactions and identified transport pathways for cargos. We extended the BioID method by the direct identification of biotinylation sites. This approach enabled us to identify interaction interfaces and to discriminate direct versus piggyback transport mechanisms. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD007976.},

Poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) hydrogels are popular 2D-model substrates for this purpose.

Here, we describe a method for bifunctional modification of PAAm hydrogels with thiol- and amine- containing biomolecules with controlled densities in an independent, orthogonal manner. We developed copolymer networks of AAm with 9\% acrylic acid and 2\% N-(4-(5-(methylsulfonyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)phenyl)acrylamide. The covalent binding of thiol- and amine-containing chromophores at tunable concentrations was demonstrated and quantified by UV spectroscopy. The morphology, mechanical properties, and homogeneity of the copolymerized hydrogels were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and confocal microscopy studies. Our copolymer hydrogels were bifunctionalized with polylysine and a laminin-mimetic peptide using the specific chemistries. We analyzed the effect of binding protocol of the two components in the maturation of cultured postmitotic cortical neurons. Our substrates supported neuronal attachment, proliferation, and neuronal differentiation. We found that neurons cultured on our hydrogels bifunctionalized with ligand-specific chemistries in a sequential fashion exhibited higher maturation at comparable culture times than using a simultaneous bifunctionalization strategy, displaying a higher number of neurites, branches, and dendritic filopodia. These results demonstrate the relevance of quantitative and optimized coupling chemistries for the performance of simple biomaterials and with sensitive cell types.},

The photopolymerization step can be performed in contact with cells, providing a means to produce bioactive scaffolds for tissue engineering. The photopolymerization conditions and precursor composition greatly affect the stiffness of the materials, which subsequently affected cell spreading.

After their enzymatic degradation with dextranase, nanogel particles swelled due to the cleavage of some glucopyranosyl bonds of dextran, but preserved their identity. On the other hand, the second family was prepared using different amounts of Dex-MA with low DS forming slightly cross-linked nanogel particles with an anomalous thermal behavior. Surprisingly, above the VPTT of the nanogel particles monodisperse interparticle reversible aggregates were formed. In addition, after their enzymatic degradation, a release of reducing sugars together with an intense de-swelling due to the fragmentation of the nanogel structure was observed.

The underlying mechanisms that establish these permeability properties remain to be fully elucidated, but require unstructured nuclear pore proteins rich in Phe-Gly (FG)-repeat domains of different types, such as FxFG and GLFG. While physical modeling and in vitro approaches have provided a framework for explaining how the FG network contributes to the barrier and transport properties of the NPC, it remains unknown whether the number and/or the spatial positioning of different FG-domains along a cylindrical, \textasciitilde{}40 nm diameter transport channel contributes to their collective properties and function. To begin to answer these questions, we have used DNA origami to build a cylinder that mimics the dimensions of the central transport channel and can house a specified number of FG-domains at specific positions with easily tunable design parameters, such as grafting density and topology. We find the overall morphology of the FG-domain assemblies to be dependent on their chemical composition, determined by the type and density of FG-repeat, and on their architectural confinement provided by the DNA cylinder, largely consistent with here presented molecular dynamics simulations based on a coarse-grained polymer model. In addition, high-speed atomic force microscopy reveals local and reversible FG-domain condensation that transiently occludes the lumen of the DNA central channel mimics, suggestive of how the NPC might establish its permeability properties.},

To overcome these limitations, here we report that the nanomechanical force from plasmonic nanobubbles increases nuclear membrane permeability and promotes universal uptake of macromolecules into the nucleus, including macromolecules that are larger than the nuclear pore complex and would otherwise not enter the nucleus. Importantly, we show that plasmonic nanobubble-induced nanomechanical transduction significantly improves gene transfection and protein expression, compared to standard electroporation treatment alone. This novel nanomechanical transduction increases the size range and is broadly applicable for macromolecule delivery to the cell nucleus, leading to new opportunities and applications including for gene therapy and anticancer drug delivery.},

However, biochemical measurements based on the population average have limitations: it is sometimes difficult to determine the amounts of insoluble proteins or low expression proteins localized in small portions of the cell. In contrast, microphotometric measurements using fluorescence microscopes enable us to detect the amounts of such proteins in situ in a particular subcellular region.

  abstract = {Summary
The largely intrinsically disordered phenylalanine-glycine-rich nucleoporins (FG Nups) underline a selectivity mechanism that enables the rapid translocation of transport factors (TFs) through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Conflicting models of NPC transport have assumed that FG Nups undergo different conformational transitions upon interacting with TFs. To selectively characterize conformational changes in FG Nups induced by TFs we performed small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast matching. Conformational-ensembles derived from SANS data indicated an increase in the overall size of FG Nups is associated with TF interaction. Moreover, the organization of the FG motif in the interacting state is consistent with prior experimental analyses defining that FG motifs undergo conformational restriction upon interacting with TFs. These results provide structural insights into a highly dynamic interaction and illustrate how functional disorder imparts rapid and selective FG Nup-TF interactions.},

Despite the development of extremely powerful multivalent binders of the Influenza virus and other viruses, comparably little is known about the optimal spacing of HA ligands, which ought to bridge binding sites within or across the trimeric HA molecules. To explore the criteria for ligand economical high affinity binding, we systematically probed distance\textendash{}affinity relationships by means of two differently behaving scaffold types based on (i) flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates and (ii) rigid self-assembled DNA{$\cdot$}PNA complexes. The bivalent scaffolds presented two sialyl-LacNAc ligands in 23\textendash{}101 \AA{} distance. A combined analysis of binding by means of microscale thermophoresis measurements and statistical mechanics models exposed the inherent limitations of PEG-based spacers. Given the distance requirements of HA, the flexibility of PEG scaffolds is too high to raise the effective concentration of glyco ligands above a value that allows interactions with the low affinity binding site. By contrast, spatial screening with less flexible, self-assembled peptide nucleic acid (PNA){$\cdot$}DNA complexes uncovered a well-defined and, surprisingly, bimodal distance\textendash{}affinity relationship for interactions of the Influenza A virus HA with bivalent displays of the natural sialyl-LacNAc ligand. Optimal constructs conferred 103-fold binding enhancements with only two ligands. We discuss the existence of secondary binding sites and shine light on the preference for intramolecular rather than intermolecular recognition of HA trimers on the virus surface.},

It is shown that pegylated protein is detectable on SDS-PAGE as well as on IEF at concentrations that are not detectable by Coomassie protein staining. This paper also describes the determination of the molecular weight of pegylated hirudin by calibrating SDS-PAGE with polyethylene glycol of different molecular weight. Under the conditions used, PEG showed linear mobility during electrophoresis. However, the use of nonpegylated proteins as standards resulted in incorrect molecular weight values due to the lower mobility of the pegylated protein during electrophoresis.

NTF2, the transport receptor of RanGDP, was exported {$\sim$}30 times faster than green fluorescent protein, an inert molecule of approximately the same size. The data confirm that restricted diffusion of inert molecules and facilitated transport of FG-repeat binding proteins are basic types of translocation through the NPC, demonstrating that the functional integrity of the NPC can be conserved in isolated nuclei and nuclear envelopes and thus opening new avenues to the analysis of nucleocytoplasmic transport.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Gene delivery from biomaterial scaffolds has been employed to induce the expression of tissue inductive factors for applications in regenerative medicine. The delivery of viral vectors has been described as reflecting a balance between vector retention and release. Herein, we investigated the design of hydrogels in order to retain the vector at the material in order to enhance transgene expression. Poly(ethylene?glycol) (PEG) hydrogels were modified with poly?l?lysine (PLL) to non?covalently bind lentivirus. For cells cultured on the hydrogels, increasing the PLL molecular weight from 1 to 70?kDa led to increased transgene expression. The incubation time of the virus with the hydrogel and the PLL concentration modulated the extent of virus adsorption, and adsorbed virus had a 20\% increase in the half?life at 37\textdegree{}C. Alternatives to high molecular weight PLL were identified through phage display technology, with peptide sequences specific for the VSV?G ectodomain, an envelope protein pseudotyped on the virus. These affinity peptides could easily be incorporated into the hydrogel, and expression was increased 20?fold relative to control peptide, and comparable to levels observed with the high molecular weight PLL. The modification of hydrogels with affinity proteins or peptides to bind lentivirus can be a powerful strategy to enhance and localized transgene expression. Biotechnol.

Whether the goal is to induce vascular growth in ischemic tissue or scale up tissue-engineered constructs, the ability to induce the growth of patent, stable vasculature is a critical obstacle. We engineered polyethylene glycol\textendash{}based bioartificial hydrogel matrices presenting protease-degradable sites, cell-adhesion motifs, and growth factors to induce the growth of vasculature in vivo. Compared to injection of soluble VEGF, these matrices delivered sustained in vivo levels of VEGF over 2 weeks as the matrix degraded. When implanted subcutaneously in rats, degradable constructs containing VEGF and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide induced a significant number of vessels to grow into the implant at 2 weeks with increasing vessel density at 4 weeks. The mechanism of enhanced vascularization is likely cell-demanded release of VEGF, as the hydrogels may degrade substantially within 2 weeks. In a mouse model of hind-limb ischemia, delivery of these matrices resulted in significantly increased rate of reperfusion. These results support the application of engineered bioartificial matrices to promote vascularization for directed regenerative therapies.},

Here, we used NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry to thermodynamically characterize these multivalent interactions. These analyses revealed that a combination of low per-FG motif affinity and the enthalpy\textendash{}entropy balance prevents high-avidity interaction between FG Nups and TFs, whereas the large number of FG motifs promotes frequent FG\textendash{}TF contacts, resulting in enhanced selectivity. Our thermodynamic model underlines the importance of functional disorder of FG Nups.

A central feature of NPC-mediated transport is the binding of cargo-carrying soluble transport factors to the unstructured regions of FG nups. Here, we model the dynamics of nucleocytoplasmic transport as diffusion in an effective potential resulting from the interaction of the transport factors with the flexible FG nups, using a minimal number of assumptions consistent with the most well-established structural and functional properties of NPC transport. We discuss how specific binding of transport factors to the FG nups facilitates transport, and how this binding and competition between transport factors and other macromolecules for binding sites and space inside the NPC accounts for the high selectivity of transport. We also account for why transport is relatively insensitive to changes in the number and distribution of FG nups in the NPC, providing an explanation for recent experiments where up to half the total mass of the FG nups has been deleted without abolishing transport.

Our analysis of intestine-expressed proteins revealed that GLH-1 and its FG domain are not sufficient to form granules, but require factors like PGL-1 to nucleate the localized concentration of GLH proteins. GLH-1 is necessary but not sufficient for the perinuclear location of granules in the intestine.

First, we characterized the phase diagram of the system and located the binodal. Second, the tie lines between the coexisting phases were determined using a method that only requires measuring the density of the coexisting phases. The interfacial tension was then measured by a spinning drop tensiometer over a broad range of polymer concentrations close to and above the critical point. In this range, the interfacial tension increases by 4 orders of magnitude with increasing polymer concentration. The scaling exponents of the interfacial tension, the correlation length, and order parameters were evaluated and showed a crossover behavior depending on the distance to the critical concentration. The scaling exponent of the interfacial tension attains the value 1.50 {$\pm$} 0.01 further away from the critical point, in good agreement with mean field theory, but the increased value 1.67 {$\pm$} 0.10 closer to this point, which disagrees with the Ising value 1.26. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy. The composition and density differences between the two coexisting phases, which may be taken as two possible order parameters, showed the expected crossover from mean field behavior to Ising model behavior as the critical point is approached. The crossover behavior of aqueous two-phase polymer solutions with increasing concentration is similar to that of polymer solutions undergoing phase separation induced by lowering the temperature.},

  abstract = {Due to mild reaction conditions and temporal and spatial control over material formation, photopolymerization has become a valuable technique for the encapsulation of living cells in three dimensional, hydrated, biomimetic materials. For such applications,2-hydroxy-1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy) phenyl]-2-methyl-1-propanone (I2959) is the most commonly used photoinitiator (by virtue of its moderate water solubility), yet this initiator has an absorption spectrum that is poorly matched with wavelengths of light generally regarded as benign to living cells, limiting the rate at which it may initiate polymerization in their presence. In contrast, acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators, generally exhibit absorption spectra at wavelengths suitable for cell encapsulation, yet commercially available initiators of this class have low water solubility. Here, a water soluble lithium acylphosphinate salt is evaluated for its ability to polymerize diacrylated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGDA) monomers rapidly into hydrogels, while maintaining high viability during direct encapsulation of cells. Through rheometric measurements, the time to reach gelation of a PEGDA solution with the phosphinate initiator is one tenth the time for that using I2959 at similar concentrations, when exposed to 365 nm light. Further, polymerization with the phosphinate initiator at 405 nm visible light exposure is achieved with low initiator concentrations and light intensities, precluded in polymerizations initiated with I2959 by its absorbance profile. When examined 24 hours after encapsulation, survival rates of human neonatal fibroblasts encapsulated in hydrogels polymerized with the phosphinate initiator exceed 95\%, demonstrating the cytocompatibility of this initiating system.},

This receptor-mediated process is essential to cellular viability as proteins are translated in the cytoplasm but many have functional roles in the nucleus. Many known karyopherin-{$\beta$}-cargo interactions were discovered through studies of the individual cargos rather than the karyopherins, and this information is thus widely scattered in the literature. We consolidate information about cargos that are directly recognized by import-karyopherin-{$\beta$}s and review common characteristics or lack thereof among cargos of different import pathways. Knowledge of karyopherin-{$\beta$}-cargo interactions is also critical for the development of nuclear import inhibitors and the understanding of their mechanisms of inhibition.

To identify rate-limiting steps in the Kap95p{$\cdot$}Kap60p-mediated nuclear import pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we reconstituted key intermediate complexes and measured their rates of dissociation and affinities of interaction. We found that a nuclear localization signal-containing protein (NLS-cargo) dissociates slowly from Kap60p monomers and Kap60p{$\cdot$}Kap95p heterodimers with half-lives (t ) of 7 and 73 min, respectively; that Kap60p and Kap60p{$\cdot$}NLS-cargo complexes dissociate slowly from Kap95p (t = 36 and 73 min, respectively); and that Kap95p{$\cdot$}Kap60p{$\cdot$}NLS-cargo complexes and Kap95p{$\cdot$}Kap60p heterodimers dissociate rapidly from the nucleoporin Nup1p (t {$\leq$} 21 s) and other Nups. A search for factors that accelerate disassembly of the long-lived intermediates revealed that Nup1p and Nup2p accelerate 16- and 19-fold the rate of dissociation of NLS-cargo from Kap60p{$\cdot$}Kap95p heterodimers; that Gsp1p-GTP accelerates {$\geq$} 447-fold the rate of dissociation of Kap60p{$\cdot$}NLS-cargo from Kap95p; and that Nup2p and the Cse1p{$\cdot$}Gsp1p-GTP complex independently accelerate {$\geq$} 22- and {$\geq$} 39-fold the rate of dissociation of NLS-cargo from Kap60p. We suggest that Nup1p, Nup2p, Cse1p, and Gsp1p accelerate disassembly of Kap95p{$\cdot$}Kap60p{$\cdot$}NLS-cargo complexes by triggering allosteric mechanisms within Kaps that cause rapid release of binding partners. In that way, Nup1p, Nup2p, Cse1p, and Gsp1p may function askaryopherin release factors (or KaRFs) in the nuclear basket structure of the S. cerevisiaeNPC.},

Cellular proteins do not work in isolation. Instead, they often function as part of large macromolecular complexes, which are transported and concentrated into specific cellular compartments and function in a highly crowded environment. A central theme of modern cell biology is to understand how such macromolecular complexes are assembled efficiently and find their destinations faithfully. In this Opinion article, we will focus on HEAT repeats, flexible arrays of amphiphilic helices found in many eukaryotic proteins, such as karyopherins and condensins, and discuss how these uniquely designed helical repeats might underlie dynamic protein\textendash{}protein interactions and support cellular functions in crowded environments. We will make bold speculations on functional similarities between the action of HEAT repeats and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in macromolecular phase separation. Potential contributions of HEAT\textendash{}HEAT interactions, as well as cooperation between HEATs and IDRs, to mesoscale organelle assembly will be discussed.},

However, the mechanism by which TFs rapidly diffuse through multiple FG repeats without compromising NPC selectivity is not yet fully understood. In this study, we build on our recent NMR investigations showing that FG repeats are highly dynamic, flexible, and rapidly exchanging among TF interaction sites. We use unbiased long timescale all-atom simulations on the Anton supercomputer, combined with extensive enhanced sampling simulations and NMR experiments, to characterize the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of FG repeats and their interaction with a model transport factor. Both the simulations and experimental data indicate that FG repeats are highly dynamic random coils, lack intrachain interactions, and exhibit significant entropically driven resistance to spatial confinement. We show that the FG motifs reversibly slide in and out of multiple TF interaction sites, transitioning rapidly between a strongly interacting state and a weakly interacting state, rather than undergoing a much slower transition between strongly interacting and completely noninteracting (unbound) states. In the weakly interacting state, FG motifs can be more easily displaced by other competing FG motifs, providing a simple mechanism for rapid exchange of TF/FG motif contacts during transport. This slide-and-exchange mechanism highlights the direct role of the disorder within FG repeats in nucleocytoplasmic transport, and resolves the apparent conflict between the selectivity and speed of transport.},

The membrane ring that equatorially circumscribes the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in the perinuclear lumen of the nuclear envelope is composed largely of Pom152 in yeast and its ortholog Nup210 (or Gp210) in vertebrates. Here, we have used a combination of negative-stain electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and small-angle X-ray scattering methods to determine an integrative structure of the {$\sim$}120~kDa luminal domain of Pom152. Our structural analysis reveals that the luminal domain is formed by a flexible string-of-pearls arrangement of nine repetitive cadherin-like Ig-like domains, indicating an evolutionary connection between NPCs and the cell adhesion machinery. The 16 copies of Pom152 known to be present in the yeast NPC are long enough to form the observed membrane ring, suggesting how interactions between Pom152 molecules help establish and maintain the NPC architecture.},

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions has been hampered by a lack of structural knowledge about the NPC. The recent convergence of crystallographic and biochemical in vitro analysis of nucleoporins (NUPs), the components of the NPC, with cryo-electron microscopic imaging of the entire NPC in situ has provided first pseudo-atomic view of its central core and revealed that an unexpected network of short linear motifs is an important spatial organization principle. These breakthroughs have transformed the way we understand NPC structure, and they provide an important base for functional investigations, including the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying clinically manifested mutations of the nucleocytoplasmic transport system.},

  abstract = {The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the selective gateway through which all molecules must pass when entering or exiting the nucleus. It is a cog in the gene expression pathway, an entrance to the nucleus exploited by viruses, and a highly-tuned nanoscale filter. The NPC is a large proteinaceous assembly with a central lumen occluded by natively disordered proteins, known as FG-nucleoporins (or FG-nups). These FG-nups, along with a family of soluble proteins known as nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), form the selective transport barrier. Although much is known about the transport cycle and the necessity of NTRs for chaperoning cargo molecules through the NPC, the mechanism by which NTRs and NTR\textbullet{}cargo complexes translocate the selective transport barrier is not well understood. How can disordered FG-nups and soluble NTRs form a transport barrier that is selective, ATP-free, and fast? In this work, we review various mechanical approaches \textendash{} both experimental and theoretical/computational \textendash{} employed to better understand the morphology of the FG-nups, and their role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Recent experiments on FG-nups tethered to planar surfaces, coupled with quantitative modelling work suggests that FG-nup morphologies are the result of a finely balanced system with significant contributions from FG-nup cohesiveness and entropic repulsion, and from NTR\textbullet{}FG-nup binding avidity; whilst AFM experiments on intact NPCs suggest that the FG-nups are sufficiently cohesive to form condensates in the centre of the NPC lumen, which may transiently dissolve to facilitate the transport of larger cargoes.},

Sequences of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs) are characterized by a number of specific features, such as low overall hydrophobicity and high net charge which makes these proteins predictable. IDPs/IDPRs possess large hydrodynamic volumes, low contents of ordered secondary structure, and are characterized by high structural heterogeneity. They are very flexible, but some may undergo disorder to order transitions in the presence of natural ligands. The degree of these structural rearrangements varies over a very wide range. IDPs/IDPRs are tightly controlled under the normal conditions and have numerous specific functions that complement functions of ordered proteins and domains. When lacking proper control, they have multiple roles in pathogenesis of various human diseases. Gaining structural and functional information about these proteins is a challenge, since they do not typically ``freeze'' while their ``pictures are taken.'' However, despite or perhaps because of the experimental challenges, these fuzzy objects with fuzzy structures and fuzzy functions are among the most interesting targets for modern protein research.

  abstract = {Molecular traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Hundreds, if not thousands, of molecules interact with and transit through each NPC every second. The pore is blocked by a permeability barrier, which consists of a network of intrinsically unfolded polypeptides containing thousands of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat motifs. This FG-network rejects larger molecules and admits smaller molecules or cargos bound to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). For a cargo transport complex, minimally consisting of a cargo molecule plus an NTR, access to the permeability barrier is provided by interactions between the NTR and the FG repeat motifs. Numerous models have been postulated to explain the controlled accessibility and the transport characteristics of the FG-network, but the amorphous, flexible nature of this structure has hindered characterization. A relatively recent development is the ability to monitor the real-time movement of single molecules through individual NPCs via single molecule fluorescence (SMF) microscopy. A major advantage of this approach is that it can be used to continuously monitor a series of specific molecular interactions in an active pore with millisecond time resolution, which therefore allows one to distinguish between kinetic and thermodynamic control.

  abstract = {Passive macromolecular diffusion through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is thought to decrease dramatically beyond a 30\textendash{}60-kD size threshold. Using thousands of independent time-resolved fluorescence microscopy measurements in vivo, we show that the NPC lacks such a firm size threshold; instead, it forms a soft barrier to passive diffusion that intensifies gradually with increasing molecular mass in both the wild-type and mutant strains with various subsets of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) domains and different levels of baseline passive permeability. Brownian dynamics simulations replicate these findings and indicate that the soft barrier results from the highly dynamic FG repeat domains and the diffusing macromolecules mutually constraining and competing for available volume in the interior of the NPC, setting up entropic repulsion forces. We found that FG domains with exceptionally high net charge and low hydropathy near the cytoplasmic end of the central channel contribute more strongly to obstruction of passive diffusion than to facilitated transport, revealing a compartmentalized functional arrangement within the NPC.},

We set out to correlate the governing biochemical interactions to the nanoscopic responses of the phenylalanineglycine (FG)\textendash{}rich nucleoporin domains, which are involved in attenuating or promoting cargo translocation. We found that binding interactions with the transport receptor karyopherin-{$\beta$}1 caused the FG domains of the human nucleoporin Nup153 to collapse into compact molecular conformations. This effect was reversed by the action of Ran guanosine triphosphate, which returned the FG domains into a polymer brush-like, entropic barrier conformation. Similar effects were observed in Xenopus oocyte nuclei in situ. Thus, the reversible collapse of the FG domains may play an important role in regulating nucleocytoplasmic transport.
Regulators of nuclear permeability reversibly collapse parts of nuclear pore proteins, a process that may underlie control of nuclear transport in cells.

Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy was used to track the movement of cargos before, during, and after their interactions with NPCs. At low importin {$\beta$} concentrations, about half of the signal-dependent cargos that interacted with an NPC were translocated across the NE, indicating a nuclear import efficiency of {$\sim$}50\%. At high importin {$\beta$} concentrations, the import efficiency increased to {$\sim$}80\% and the transit speed increased approximately sevenfold. The transit speed and import efficiency of a signal-independent cargo was also increased by high importin {$\beta$} concentrations. These results demonstrate that maximum nucleocytoplasmic transport velocities can be modulated by at least {$\sim$}10-fold by the importin {$\beta$} concentration and therefore suggest a potential mechanism for regulating the speed of cargo traffic across the NE.},

After bleaching the dominant GFP fluorescence the interactions of the microinjected molecules could be studied using video microscopy with a time resolution of 5 ms, achieving a colocalization precision of 30 nm. These measurements allowed defining the interaction sites with the NPCs with an unprecedented precision, and the comparison of the interaction kinetics with previous in vitro measurements revealed new insights into the translocation mechanism.},

Single molecule methods can provide unique information on topographic properties and kinetic processes of asynchronous supramolecular assemblies with excellent spatial and time resolution. Here, single-molecule far-field fluorescence microscopy was applied to the NPC of permeabilized cells. The nucleoporin Nup358 could be localized at a distance of 70 nm from POM121-GFP along the NPC axis. Binding sites of NTF2, the transport receptor of RanGDP, were observed in cytoplasmic filaments and central framework, but not nucleoplasmic filaments of the NPC. The dwell times of NTF2 and transportin 1 at their NPC binding sites were 5.8 {$\pm$} 0.2 and 7.1 {$\pm$} 0.2 ms, respectively. Notably, the dwell times of these receptors were reduced upon binding to a specific transport substrate, suggesting that translocation is accelerated for loaded receptor molecules. Together with the known transport rates, our data suggest that nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs via multiple parallel pathways within single NPCs.},

This report proposes a bio-inspired concept to regulate dynamic gradients through the coupled supramolecular binding and diffusion process in receptor-embedded hydrogel matrices. A new type of hydrogel that uses cyclodextrin (CD) as both the gelling moiety and the receptors is prepared as the diffusion matrices. The diffusible guest, 4-aminoazobenzene, quickly and reversibly binds to matrices-bound CD during diffusion and generates steeper gradients than regular diffusion. Weakened bindings induced through UV irradiation extend the gradients. Combined with numerical simulation, these results indicate that the coupled binding\textendash{}diffusion could be viewed as slowed diffusion, regulated jointly by the binding constant and the equilibrium receptor concentrations, and gradients within a bio-relevant extent of 4 mm are preserved up to 90 h. This report should inspire design strategies of biomedical or cell-culturing materials.},

Low-resolution structural studies of gels demonstrated changes in morphology and porous network dimensions as FG-repeat concentration was varied. Copolymerization of charged acrylates within the polyacrylamide/FSFG matrix was performed to produce charged hydrogels. Enhanced entry of Imp{$\beta$}, which is negatively charged, was observed in positively charged hydrogels, whereas entry was greatly diminished in negatively charged gels.

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach to solving the phase problem in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion pore imaging, a method that allows imaging the shape of arbitrary closed pores filled with an NMR-detectable medium for investigation of the microstructure of biological tissue and porous materials. Classical q-space imaging composed of two short diffusion-encoding gradient pulses yields, analogously to diffraction experiments, the modulus squared of the Fourier transform of the pore image which entails an inversion problem: An unambiguous reconstruction of the pore image requires both magnitude and phase. Here the phase information is recovered from the Fourier modulus by applying a phase retrieval algorithm. This allows omitting experimentally challenging phase measurements using specialized temporal gradient profiles. A combination of the hybrid input-output algorithm and the error reduction algorithm was used with dynamically adapting support (shrinkwrap extension). No a priori knowledge on the pore shape was fed to the algorithm except for a finite pore extent. The phase retrieval approach proved successful for simulated data with and without noise and was validated in phantom experiments with well-defined pores using hyperpolarized xenon gas.},

Favorable cation-{$\pi$} interactions between arginines and FG-phenylalanines may explain this apparent paradox. Application of these principles to redesign the surface of GFP resulted in variants that show a wide span of transit rates, ranging from 35-fold slower than wild-type to {$\sim$}500 times faster, with the latter outpacing even naturally occurring nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). The structure of a fast and particularly FG-specific GFPNTR variant illustrates how NTRs can expose multiple regions for binding hydrophobic FG motifs while evading non-specific aggregation. Finally, we document that even for NTR-mediated transport, the surface-properties of the ``passively carried'' cargo can strikingly affect the translocation rate.},

  abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) control all traffic into and out of the cell nucleus. NPCs are molecular machines that simultaneously achieve high selectivity and high transport rates. The biophysical details of how cargoes rapidly traverse the pore remain unclear but are known to be mediated by interactions between cargo-binding chaperone proteins and natively unstructured nucleoporin proteins containing many phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG nups) that line the pore's central channel. Here, we propose a specific and detailed physical mechanism for the high speed of nuclear import based on the elasticity of FG~nups and on competition between individual chaperone proteins for FG nup binding. We develop a mathematical model to support our proposed mechanism. We suggest that the recycling of nuclear import factors back to the cytoplasm is important for driving high-speed import and predict the existence of an optimal cytoplasmic concentration of cargo for enhancing the rate of import over a purely diffusive rate.},

  abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) act as effective and robust gateways between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, selecting for the passage of particular macromolecules across the nuclear envelope. NPCs comprise an elaborate scaffold that defines a {$\sim$}30 nm diameter passageway connecting the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This scaffold anchors proteins termed `phenylalanine-glycine' (FG)-nucleoporins, the natively disordered domains of which line the passageway and extend into its lumen1. Passive diffusion through this lined passageway is hindered in a size-dependent manner. However, transport factors and their cargo-bound complexes overcome this restriction by transient binding to the FG-nucleoporins2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. To test whether a simple passageway and a lining of transport-factor-binding FG-nucleoporins are sufficient for selective transport, we designed a functionalized membrane that incorporates just these two elements. Here we demonstrate that this membrane functions as a nanoselective filter, efficiently passing transport factors and transport-factor\textendash{}cargo complexes that specifically bind FG-nucleoporins, while significantly inhibiting the passage of proteins that do not. This inhibition is greatly enhanced when transport factor is present. Determinants of selectivity include the passageway diameter, the length of the nanopore region coated with FG-nucleoporins, the binding strength to FG-nucleoporins, and the antagonistic effect of transport factors on the passage of proteins that do not specifically bind FG-nucleoporins. We show that this artificial system faithfully reproduces key features of trafficking through the NPC, including transport-factor-mediated cargo import.},

  abstract = {Biomolecule-functionalized hydrogels have emerged as valuable cell culture platforms to recapitulate the mechanical and biochemical properties of the extracellular niche. The typical strategy to functionalize hydrogels with biomolecules involves directly tethering them to the hydrogel backbone resulting in a static material. Thus, this approach fails to capture the dynamic changes in biomolecule composition that occur during biological processes or that may be required for regenerative medicine applications. Moreover, it also limits the scope of biomolecules to simple peptides, as signaling proteins generally have poor stability under cell culture conditions and lose their bioactivity over time. To that end, we sought to develop a bioconjugation reaction that would enable reversible and repeatable tethering of signaling proteins to hydrogels, so that spent protein could be released on-demand and replaced with fresh protein as needed. Specifically, we designed an allyl sulfide chain-transfer agent that enables a reversible, photomediated, thiol\textendash{}ene bioconjugation of signaling proteins to hydrogels. Upon addition of a thiolated protein to the allyl sulfide moiety, the previously tethered protein is released, and the ``ene'' functionality is regenerated. Using this approach, we demonstrate that protein patterning can be achieved in hydrogels through a thiol\textendash{}ene reaction, and the patterned protein can then be released through a subsequent thiol\textendash{}ene reaction of a PEG thiol. Importantly, this process is repeatable through multiple iterations and proceeds at physiologically relevant signaling protein concentrations. Finally, we demonstrate that whole signaling proteins can be patterned and released in the presence of cells, and that cells respond to their presentation with spatial fidelity. Combined, these data represent the first example of a methodology that enables fully reversible and repeatable patterning and release of signaling proteins from hydrogels.},

  abstract = {A recent advance in understanding stem cell differentiation is that the cell is able to translate its morphology, i.e. roundish or spread, into a fate decision. We hypothesise that strain states in the nuclear envelope (NE) cause changes in the structure of the nuclear pore complexes. This induces significant changes in the NE's permeability to the traffic of the transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation which are imported into the nucleus by passive diffusion. To demonstrate this, we set up a numerical model of the transport of diffusive molecules through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), on the basis of the NPC deformation. We then compared the prediction of the model for two different cell configurations with roundish and spread nuclear topologies with those measured on cells cultured in both configurations. To measure the geometrical features of the NPC, using electron tomography we reconstructed three-dimensional portions of the envelope of cells cultured in both configurations. We found non-significant differences in both the shape and size of the transmembrane ring of single pores with envelope deformation. In the numerical model, we thus assumed that the changes in pore complex permeability, caused by the envelope strains, are due to variations in the opening configuration of the nuclear basket, which in turn modifies the porosity of the pore complex mainly on its nuclear side. To validate the model, we cultured cells on a substrate shaped as a spatial micro-grid, called the ``nichoid'', which is nanoengineered by two-photon laser polymerization, and induces a roundish nuclear configuration in cells adhering to the nichoid grid, and a spread configuration in cells adhering to the flat substrate surrounding the grid. We then measured the diffusion through the nuclear envelope of an inert green-fluorescent protein, by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Finally, we compared the diffusion times predicted by the numerical model for roundish versus spread cells, with the measured times. Our data show that cell stretching modulates the characteristic time needed for the nuclear import of a small inert molecule, GFP, and the model predicts a faster import of diffusive molecules in the spread compared to roundish cells.},

How is directionality achieved? How can the receptors be both specific and versatile in recognizing a multitude of cargoes? And how can their interaction with NPCs allow fast translocation?

  abstract = {The nuclear pore complex, the only pathway for transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm, functions as a highly selective gate that blocks nonspecific macromolecules while allowing the rapid transport of tagged [transport factor (TF) bound] cargo up to an order of magnitude larger. The mechanism of this gate's operation is not yet fully understood and progress has been primarily hindered by the inherent complexity and multiscale nature of the problem. One needs to consider the hundreds of disordered proteins (phenylalanine glycine nucleoporins or FG nups) lining the pore, as well as their overall architecture and dynamics at the microsecond scale, while also accounting for transport at the millisecond scale across the entire pore. Here we formulate an approach that addresses transport properties over a large range of length and time scales. We do this by incorporating microscopic biophysical details, such as charge and specific TF-FG nup interactions, to compute the free energy landscape encountered by the cargo. We connect this to macroscopic transport by treating cargo translocation as a stochastic barrier crossing process and computing the current and the translocation time. We then identify distinct transport regimes (fast permeable, slow permeable, and impermeable) determined by the cargo size, TF affinity for FG nups, and the activity of the enzymes that cleave TFs from cargo. Our results, therefore provide an integrated picture of transport through the NPC, while highlighting how FG nup interactions with TFs and enzyme activity cooperate to produce selectivity and efficiency.},

We further demonstrate that these membranes can be used for previously unachievable applications, including serving as particle barriers that allow macroscopic device access through the membrane (for example, open surgery) or as selective membranes inhibiting gas/vapor passage while allowing solids to pass through them (for example, waste/odor management).},

  abstract = {Biological systems routinely regulate biomolecular transport with remarkable specificity, low energy input, and simple mechanisms. Here, the biophysical mechanisms of nuclear transport inspire the development of gels for recognition and selective permeation (GRASP). GRASP presents a new paradigm for specific transport and selective permeability, in which binding interactions between a biomolecule and a hydrogel lead to faster penetration of the gel. A molecular transport theory identifies key principles for selective transport: entropic repulsion of noninteracting molecules and affinity-mediated diffusion of multireceptor biomolecules through a walking mechanism. The ability of interacting molecules to walk through hydrogels enables enhanced permeability in polymer networks. To realize this theoretical prediction in a novel material, GRASP is engineered from a poly(ethylene glycol) network (entropic barrier) containing antibody-binding oligopeptides (affinity domains). GRASP is synthesized using simultaneous bioconjugation and polycondensation reactions. The elastic modulus, characteristic pore size, biomolecular diffusivity, and selective permeability are measured in the resulting materials, which are applied to regulate the transport of equally sized molecules by preferentially transporting a monoclonal antibody from a polyclonal mixture. Overall, this work presents rationally designed, nucleopore-inspired hydrogels that are capable of controlling biomolecular transport.},

Bacterial proliferation is the product of both replication and killing undergone by the population. However, these processes are difficult to distinguish, and are usually assessed together by determination of net bacterial load. In addition, measurement of net load does not reveal heterogeneity within pathogen populations. This is particularly important in persistent infections in which slow or nongrowing bacteria are thought to have a major impact. Here we report the development of a reporter system based on fluorescence dilution that enables direct quantification of the replication dynamics of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) in murine macrophages at both the population and single-cell level. We used this technique to demonstrate that a major S. Typhimurium virulence determinant, the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 type III secretion system, is required for bacterial replication but does not have a major influence on resistance to killing. Furthermore, we found that, upon entry into macrophages, many bacteria do not replicate, but appear to enter a dormant-like state. These could represent an important reservoir of persistent bacteria. The approach could be extended to other pathogens to study the contribution of virulence and host resistance factors to replication and killing, and to identify and characterize nonreplicating bacteria associated with chronic or latent infections.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000804},
  abstract = {The functioning of living cells requires efficient and selective transport of materials into and out of the cell, and between different cellular compartments. Much of this transport occurs through nano-scale channels that do not require large scale molecular re-arrangements (such as transition from a `closed' to an `open' state) and do not require a direct input of metabolic energy during transport. Nevertheless, these `always open' channels are highly selective and pass only their cognate molecules, while efficiently excluding all others; indeed, these channels can efficiently transport specific molecules even in the presence of a vast excess of non-specific molecules. Such biological transporters have inspired the creation of artificial nano-channels. These channels can be used as nano-molecular sorters, and can also serve as testbeds for examining modes of biological transport. In this paper, we propose a simple kinetic mechanism that explains how the selectivity of such `always open' channels can be based on the exclusion of non-specific molecules by specific ones, due to the competition for limited space inside the channel. The predictions of the theory account for the behavior of the nuclear pore complex and of artificial nanopores that mimic its function. This theory provides the basis for future work aimed at understanding the selectivity of various biological transport phenomena., Various channels and transporters shuttle molecules into and out of the cell, as well as between different cell compartments. Such channels have be selective, i.e. to pass only certain molecular species in a given direction, while efficiently blocking the passage of all others. Transport properties of some channels (e.g. ion channels), have been extensively studied. However, the mechanisms of channels that conduct larger molecules, such as the nuclear pore complex, which gates all transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm, are less understood. In particular, it is still not clear how such channels can efficiently transport their specific molecules even in the presence of a vast excess of non-specific molecules that potentially could clog the channel. Understanding how such channels work is also important for technological applications, such as design of artificial nano-filters. In this paper, we propose a mechanism of selectivity of such channels in the presence of vast amounts of background molecular noise. The predictions of the theory account for the behavior of the nuclear pore complex and of artificial nanochannels that mimic its function.

  abstract = {Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is both a first responder to DNA damage and a chromatin architectural protein. How PARP1 rapidly finds DNA damage sites in the context of a nucleus filled with undamaged DNA, to which it also binds, is an unresolved question. Here, we show that PARP1 association with DNA is diffusion-limited, and release of PARP1 from DNA is promoted by binding of an additional DNA molecule that facilitates a `monkey bar' mechanism, also known as intersegment transfer. The WGR-domain of PARP1 is essential to this mechanism, and a point mutation (W589A) recapitulates the altered kinetics of the domain deletion. Demonstrating the physiological importance of the monkey bar mechanism for PARP1 function, the W589A mutant accumulates at sites of DNA damage more slowly following laser micro-irradiation than wild-type PARP1. Clinically relevant inhibitors of PARP1 did not alter the rate or mechanism of the release of PARP1 from DNA.},

A powerful tool for studying the orchestrated accumulation of these proteins at damage sites is laser microirradiation in live cells, followed by monitoring of the accumulation of the fluorescently labeled protein in question. Despite the widespread use of this approach, there exists no rigorous method for characterizing this process quantitatively. Here we introduce a free diffusion model that explicitly accounts for the unique topology of individual nuclei and quantitatively describes the accumulation of two test proteins, poly-ADP-ribose polymerases 1 and 2.

Our emphasis is on the structural principles that underlie chromosome organization, with a particular focus on the intrinsic contributions of the 10-nm chromatin fiber, but not the regular 30-nm fiber. We hypothesize that the hierarchical globular organization of an interphase chromosome is fundamentally established by the self-interacting properties of a 10-nm zig-zag array of nucleosomes, while histone post-translational modifications, histone variants, and chromatin-associated proteins serve to mold generic chromatin domains into specific structural and functional entities.},

The hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of individual samples of dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyoxyethylene over a range of molecular weights (1500\textendash{}2,000,000) were calculated from their intrinsic viscosities using the Einstein viscosity relation and directly measured by quasi-elastic light scattering, and the effect of each polymer sample on RBC aggregation was studied by nephelometry and low-shear viscometry. For all three polymers, despite their different structures, samples with Rh {$<$}4 nm were found to inhibit aggregation, whereas those with Rh {$>$}4 nm enhanced aggregation. Inhibition increased with Rh and was maximal at {$\sim$}3 nm; above 4 nm the pro-aggregant effect increased with Rh. For comparison, the Rh of 12 plasma proteins were calculated from literature values of intrinsic viscosity or diffusion coefficient. Each protein known to promote RBC aggregation had Rh {$>$}4 nm, whereas those with Rh {$<$}4 nm either inhibited or had no effect on aggregation. These results suggest that the influence of a nonionic polymer or plasma protein on RBC aggregation is simply a consequence of its size in an aqueous environment, and that the specific type of macromolecule is of minor importance.},

To unravel the higher-order folding of chromatin, we used magnetic tweezers and probed the mechanical properties of single 197-bp repeat length arrays of 25 nucleosomes. At forces up to 4 pN, the 30-nm fiber stretches like a Hookian spring, resulting in a three-fold extension. Together with a high nucleosome-nucleosome stacking energy, this points to a solenoid as the underlying topology of the 30-nm fiber. Unexpectedly, linker histones do not affect the length or stiffness of the fiber but stabilize its folding. Fibers with a nucleosome repeat length of 167 bp are stiffer, consistent with a two-start helical arrangement. The observed high compliance causes extensive thermal breathing, which forms a physical basis for the balance between DNA condensation and accessibility.},

Although the structure of its scaffold is being revealed in increasing detail, its transport functionality depends upon an assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins (called FG-Nups) anchored inside the pore's central channel, which have hitherto eluded structural characterization. Here, using high-resolution atomic force microscopy, we provide a structural and nanomechanical analysis of individual NPCs. Our data highlight the structural diversity and complexity at the nuclear envelope, showing the interplay between the lamina network, actin filaments, and the NPCs. It reveals the dynamic behaviour of NPC scaffolds and displays pores of varying sizes. Of functional importance, the NPC central channel shows large structural diversity, supporting the notion that FG-Nup cohesiveness is in a range that facilitates collective rearrangements at little energetic cost. Finally, different nuclear transport receptors are shown to interact in qualitatively different ways with the FG-Nups, with particularly strong binding of importin-{$\beta$}.},

As prepared glasses possess wormhole-like mesostructure with different textural characteristics and it varies with surfactant concentrations. The pristine MBGs have been characterized by various analytical techniques before and after immersing in simulated body fluid (SBF). The textural properties show non-monotonous variations with varying the surfactant concentrations. We have quantified the various structural species present in the glass sample by using local structural probe such as nuclear magnetic resonance technique. Invitro studies on the MBGs revealed the influence of textural characteristics on the formation of nano-crystalline hydroxycarbonated apatite (HCA) layer. The biodegradability is largely related to the pore architecture and it affects the biocompatibility as well as bone formation. In-vitro studies reveals that there are serious negative effects that have been observed in the case of larger pore sized samples due to rapid degradation. We found that MBG with pore sizes of few nano meters exhibit favorable biocompatibility in vitro behavior and found to be promising candidate in the field of biomaterials including tissue regeneration and drug storage.},

Using experimental examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of such an approach in FRAP analysis.},

This is a fluorescence technique that is able to localize the position of a single dye within {$\sim$}1 nm in the x-y plane. It is done simply by taking the point spread function of a single fluorophore excited with wide field illumination and locating the center of the fluorescent spot by a two-dimensional Gaussian fit. We motivate the development of FIONA by unraveling the walking mechanism of the molecular motors myosin V, myosin VI, and kinesin. We find that they all walk in a hand-over-hand fashion.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is now widely used to investigate binding interactions in live cells. Although various idealized solutions have been identified for the reaction-diffusion equations that govern FRAP, there has been no comprehensive analysis or systematic approach to serve as a guide for extracting binding information from an arbitrary FRAP curve. Here we present a complete solution to the FRAP reaction-diffusion equations for either single or multiple independent binding interactions, and then relate our solution to the various idealized cases. This yields a coherent approach to extract binding information from FRAP data which we have applied to the question of transcription factor mobility in the nucleus. We show that within the nucleus, the glucocorticoid receptor is transiently bound to a single state, with each molecule binding on average 65 sites per second. This rapid sampling is likely to be important in finding a specific promoter target sequence. Further we show that this predominant binding state is not the nuclear matrix, as some studies have suggested. We illustrate how our analysis provides several self-consistency checks on a FRAP fit. We also define constraints on what can be estimated from FRAP data, show that diffusion should play a key role in many FRAP recoveries, and provide tools to test its contribution. Overall our approach establishes a more general framework to assess the role of diffusion, the number of binding states, and the binding constants underlying a FRAP recovery.},

  abstract = {Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are large protein complexes embedded in the nuclear envelope separating the cytoplasm from the nucleoplasm in eukaryotic cells. They function as selective gates for the transport of molecules in and out of the nucleus. The inner wall of the NPC is coated with intrinsically disordered proteins rich in phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-repeats), which are responsible for the intriguing selectivity of NPCs. The phosphorylation state of the FG-Nups is controlled by kinases and phosphatases. In the current study, we extended our one-bead-per-amino-acid (1BPA) model for intrinsically disordered proteins to account for phosphorylation. With this, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to probe the effect of phosphorylation on the Stokes radius of isolated FG-Nups, and on the structure and transport properties of the NPC. Our results indicate that phosphorylation causes a reduced attraction between the residues, leading to an extension of the FG-Nups and the formation of a significantly less dense FG-network inside the NPC. Furthermore, our simulations show that upon phosphorylation, the transport rate of inert molecules increases, while that of nuclear transport receptors decreases, which can be rationalized in terms of modified hydrophobic, electrostatic, and steric interactions. Altogether, our models provide a molecular framework to explain how extensive phosphorylation of FG-Nups decreases the selectivity of the NPC.},

We developed conditions to allow the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was chosen because of its genetic tractability, as a eukaryotic expression system for in-cell NMR. We demonstrate this technique using a fragment of S. cerevisiae Nsp1, an FG Nup. FG Nups are intrinsically disordered proteins containing phenylalanine (F)-glycine (G) repeats and form the selective barrier within the nuclear pore complex. Yeast FG Nups have previously been shown to be maintained in a highly dynamic state within living bacteria as measured by in-cell NMR. Interactions thought to stabilize this dynamic state are also present in the protein's native organism, although site specificity of interaction is different between the two cytosols.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of cross-{$\beta$}-sheet amyloid fibrils is the hallmark of amyloid diseases. Recently, we reported the discovery of amyloid disaggregase activities in extracts from mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans. However, we have discovered a problem with the interpretation of our previous results as A{$\beta$} disaggregation in vitro. Here, we show that A{$\beta$} fibrils adsorb to the plastic surface of multiwell plates and Eppendorf tubes. This adsorption is markedly increased in the presence of complex biological mixtures subjected to a denaturing air-water interface. The time-dependent loss of thioflavin T fluorescence that we interpreted previously as disaggregation is due to increased adsorption of A{$\beta$} amyloid to the surfaces of multiwell plates and Eppendorf tubes in the presence of biological extracts. As the proteins in biological extracts denature over time at the air-water interface due to agitation/shaking, their adsorption increases, in turn promoting adsorption of amyloid fibrils. We delineate important control experiments that quantify the extent of amyloid adsorption to the surface of plastic and quartz containers. Based on the results described in this article, we conclude that our interpretation of the kinetic fibril disaggregation assay data previously reported in Bieschke et al., Protein Sci 2009;18:2231\textendash{}2241 and Murray et al., Protein Sci 2010;19:836\textendash{}846 is invalid when used as evidence for a disaggregase activity. Thus, we correct the two prior publications reporting that worm or mammalian cell extracts disaggregate A{$\beta$} amyloid fibrils in vitro at 37\textdegree{}C (see Corrigenda in this issue of Protein Science). We apologize for misinterpreting our previous data and for any confounding experimental efforts this may have caused.},

Different types of binding sites are likely to be present in amyloid fibrils with differences in binding modes. ThT may bind in channels running parallel to the long axis of the fibril. In the channels, ThT may bind in either a monomeric or dimeric form of which the molecular conformation is likely to be planar.

  abstract = {Importin {$\beta$} family transport receptors shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and mediate transport of macromolecules through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The interactions between these receptors and their cargoes are regulated by binding RanGTP; all receptors probably exit the nucleus complexed with RanGTP, and so should deplete RanGTP continuously from the nucleus. We describe here the development of an in vitro system to study how nuclear Ran is replenished. Nuclear import of Ran does not rely on simple diffusion as Ran's small size would permit, but instead is stimulated by soluble transport factors. This facilitated import is specific for cytoplasmic RanGDP and employs nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) as the actual carrier. NTF2 binds RanGDP initially to NPCs and probably also mediates translocation of the NTF2\textendash{}RanGDP complex to the nuclear side of the NPCs. A direct NTF2\textendash{}RanGDP interaction is crucial for this process, since point mutations that disturb the RanGDP\textendash{}NTF2 interaction also interfere with Ran import. The subsequent nuclear accumulation of Ran also requires GTP, but not GTP hydrolysis. The release of Ran from NTF2 into the nucleus, and thus the directionality of Ran import, probably involves nucleotide exchange to generate RanGTP, for which NTF2 has no detectable affinity, followed by binding of the RanGTP to an importin {$\beta$} family transport receptor.},

We constructed Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants with asymmetric FG repeats either deleted or swapped to generate NPCs with inverted FG asymmetry.

  abstract = {A biofilm is a structured consortium of bacteria embedded in a self-produced polymer matrix consisting of polysaccharide, protein and DNA. Bacterial biofilms cause chronic infections because they show increased tolerance to antibiotics and disinfectant chemicals as well as resisting phagocytosis and other components of the body's defence system. The persistence of, for example, staphylococcal infections related to foreign bodies is due to biofilm formation. Likewise, chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients is caused by biofilm-growing mucoid strains. Characteristically, gradients of nutrients and oxygen exist from the top to the bottom of biofilms and these gradients are associated with decreased bacterial metabolic activity and increased doubling times of the bacterial cells; it is these more or less dormant cells that are responsible for some of the tolerance to antibiotics. Biofilm growth is associated with an increased level of mutations as well as with quorum-sensing-regulated mechanisms. Conventional resistance mechanisms such as chromosomal beta-lactamase, upregulated efflux pumps and mutations in antibiotic target molecules in bacteria also contribute to the survival of biofilms. Biofilms can be prevented by early aggressive antibiotic prophylaxis or therapy and they can be treated by chronic suppressive therapy. A promising strategy may be the use of enzymes that can dissolve the biofilm matrix (e.g. DNase and alginate lyase) as well as quorum-sensing inhibitors that increase biofilm susceptibility to antibiotics.},

  abstract = {Biological hydrogels such as mucus, extracellular matrix, biofilms, and the nuclear pore have diverse functions and compositions, but all act as selectively permeable barriers to the diffusion of particles. Each barrier has a crosslinked polymeric mesh that blocks penetration of large particles such as pathogens, nanotherapeutics, or macromolecules. These polymeric meshes also employ interactive filtering, in which affinity between solutes and the gel matrix controls permeability. Interactive filtering affects the transport of particles of all sizes including peptides, antibiotics, and nanoparticles and in many cases this filtering can be described in terms of the effects of charge and hydrophobicity. The concepts described in this review can guide strategies to exploit or overcome gel barriers, particularly for applications in diagnostics, pharmacology, biomaterials, and drug delivery.},

Over the past few decades, interest in the thiol-Michael addition reaction has increased dramatically, as is evidenced by the number of studies that have been dedicated to elucidating different aspects of the reaction that range from an in-depth analysis aimed at understanding the mechanistic pathways of the reaction to synthetic studies that have examined modifying molecular structures with the aim of yielding highly efficient thiol-Michael reaction monomers. This review examines the reaction mechanisms, the substrates and catalysts used in the reaction, and the subsequent implementation of the thiol-Michael reaction in materials science over the years, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the arena over the past decade.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.bpj.2014.12.041},
  abstract = {The transport channel of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) contains a high density of intrinsically disordered proteins that are rich in phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat motifs (FG Nups). The FG Nups interact promiscuously with various nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), such as karyopherins (Kaps), that mediate the trafficking of nucleocytoplasmic cargoes while also generating a selectively permeable barrier against other macromolecules. Although the binding of NTRs to FG Nups increases molecular crowding in the NPC transport channel, it is unclear how this impacts FG Nup barrier function or the movement of other molecules, such as the Ran importer NTF2. Here, we use surface plasmon resonance to evaluate FG Nup conformation, binding equilibria, and interaction kinetics associated with the multivalent binding of NTF2 and karyopherin{$\beta$}1 (Kap{$\beta$}1) to Nsp1p molecular brushes. NTF2 and Kap{$\beta$}1 show different long- and short-lived binding characteristics that emerge from varying degrees of molecular retention and FG repeat binding avidity within the Nsp1p brush. Physiological concentrations of NTF2 produce a collapse of Nsp1p brushes, whereas Kap{$\beta$}1 binding generates brush extension. However, the presence of prebound Kap{$\beta$}1 inhibits Nsp1p brush collapse during NTF2 binding, which is dominated by weak, short-lived interactions that derive from steric hindrance and diminished avidity with Nsp1p. This suggests that binding promiscuity confers kinetic advantages to NTF2 by expediting its facilitated diffusion and reinforces the proposal that Kap{$\beta$}1 contributes to the integral barrier function of the NPC.},
